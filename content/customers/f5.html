F5 solutions broaden the reach of IT through an open, extensible framework and a rich partner ecosystem of leading technology and data center orchestration vendors.

				<h3 class="mt-5">The Challenge</h3>
				<p>Initially, F5 had implemented Neolane as a marketing automation platform across North America and were looking to roll this out across multiple territories in EMEA and APAC. With a limited marketing resource in EMEA, they were looking to find a trusted, expert partner who could assist with this significant project. CRMT are a Neolane approved partner and F5 opted to leverage their expertise. Later F5 looked to review alternative marketing automation platforms and looked to CRMT to advice and then, following the selection of a platform, assistance in migrating to Marketo.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>CRMT offered independent platform advice&nbsp;</li>
					<li>Assisted in migration to Marketo &nbsp;</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 class="mt-5">The Solution</h3>
				<p>CRMT educated F5 with regard to the more complex areas of marketing automation such as lead scoring and helped them to develop a sophisticated lead scoring system which has continued to evolve.&nbsp;</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Development of a marketing automation roadmap&nbsp;</li>
					<li>Assisting with evolution as business requirements change</li>
					<li>Specialist technical assistance for CSS, Javascript and coding</li>
				</ul>
