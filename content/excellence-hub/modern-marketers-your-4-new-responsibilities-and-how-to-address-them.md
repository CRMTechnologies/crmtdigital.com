Marketing’s responsibilities are changing, moving from the silo of ‘pure marketing’ and into a blend of other departments including IT. This change in responsibilities has, in many cases, made marketing the driving force behind the business; it is no longer a surprise to see CMOs brushing shoulders with the board-level CFO or CEO. This SlideShare outlines four of the new responsibilities of marketing and how to address them.

### Takeaways:

* As Marketing’s responsibilities broaden, marketers’ understanding of people remains key.
* Marketing Operations can forge beneficial links between Sales and Marketing.
* Amid masses of data, think very critically about metrics and which offer insights about real performance.
