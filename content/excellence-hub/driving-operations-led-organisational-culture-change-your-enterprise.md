Marketing Operations bridge the left/right brain divide and bring an enhanced level of effectiveness into your business by combining IT and marketing functions in one dedicated team. Bridging these two previously separate disciplines requires a cultural shift - silos must be broken down and all aspects of the business, including Sales, must be brought into play. The reward for driving such an organisational culture change is an enhanced understanding of the customer, increased visibility of metrics of success across all departments and ultimately business growth. Find out how Marketing Operations can be enabled through driving cultural change through your business in this infographic below.
