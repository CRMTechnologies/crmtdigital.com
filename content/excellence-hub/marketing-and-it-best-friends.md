“Who’s responsible for the web, you or the IT department?”

This is a question that’s been asked of marketers since the web was born. With Marketing Operations now merging two functional areas - Marketing and IT - the question is evolving.

Large areas of technology infrastructure - CRM systems, company-wide databases, sales data and financials - are coming together as one deeply-connected source of competitive advantage. Reaching out to customers isn’t the sole domain of marketing any more, nor is technology just the realm of IT.

Companies face different challenges, but aligning departments to work in a holistic manner will improve collaboration, understanding, customer journeys and - ultimately - drive profits. Once you’ve aligned Marketing and IT, you can take your first steps towards a Marketing Operations strategy.
