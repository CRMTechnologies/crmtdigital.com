Data interoperability is becoming essential for organisations who want to run successful marketing campaigns. As strategies evolve, an increasing amount of data is arriving from multiple sources, which needs to be managed, organised and used responsively. With this increase in data, Marketing are moving in on IT spend to narrow silos, but this runs the risk of inconsistencies across data handling. We've created a slideshare that provides organisations with best practices for data interoperability, with a focus on why providing technical marketing and training to Sales and Marketing is so important.
