Are you ready? If not, you're not alone. But marketers have a responsibility in compliance and The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will happen on your watch. So it's vital to be well prepared. If you only read one GDPR guide for marketing, make it this one.

###### Our eGuide provides 10 practical best practice steps towards GDPR compliance for marketers, including:

* Aligning all members of your organisation and driving internal education.
* Auditing your marketing automation systems (e.g. Eloqua, Marketo, Pardot).
* Auditing your sales systems (e.g. Salesforce.com, Microsoft Dynamics, Oracle CRM) and reviewing data processes.
* Developing a roadmap strategy for ongoing GDPR compliance.
