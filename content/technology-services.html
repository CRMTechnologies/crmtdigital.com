        <h5>Normalator</h5>
        <p>Segmentation, lead scoring and personalisation are all essential aims of any successful Marketing Operations programme to help marketers improve campaign conversion and customer engagement. Asking potential buyers for detailed information on their requirements on a contact form can in most cases be a real challenge - most prospects are willing to provide company information and job title and in often ends here. Such data is a rich honey pot of goodness for marketers to use in personalised content. For Sales, used in the right way, it’s highly valuable to improve lead quality and buyer insight. Yet it’s often ignored as being too complicated to work with. These fields are often presented as free text in forms and can vary significantly across companies and industries.</p>

        <h5>Demand.Center</h5>
        <p>Today’s disparate marketing operations & central/field marketing teams lack a central management platform to schedule and visualise the specification, build, test, approval and deployment of campaigns in conjunction with their existing investments in Automation.
        <p>Demand.Center is a technology platform that enables marketing operations and field marketing to align upon a common infrastructure to maximise the effectiveness and production efficiency of campaign build, testing, approval and deployment locally, regionally and globally.</p>
