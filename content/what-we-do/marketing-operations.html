				<p>Continuous improvement is at the heart of assessment and benchmarking. It can only be achieved within a culture where there is genuine concern, dedication and a willingness among management and employees to improve.</p>
				<p>While the marketing executive team sets the strategy and vision, Marketing Operations conducts the benchmarking and assessments to determine what standards, best-practices, processes, technology and skills are needed to deliver. Marketing Operations enables marketing organisations to become, and serve as, a centre of excellence.</p>
