				<h3 class="h5">Data Normalisation</h3>
				<p>Effective campaign targeting requires good and accurate segmentation. This can present a real problem when dealing with contact forms that incorporate free text fields and sections that vary widely across companies and industries. Our team can normalise your data, making it simpler for you to target your campaigns effectively.</p> 
				<p>For users of Eloqua and Marketo, we have taken this process one step further by developing Normalator, which takes free text fields and automatically normalises the data into categories that you choose.</p>

				<h3 class="h5">Data Management Platforms</h3>
				<p>Say goodbye to multiple sources of inconsistent customer and prospect data. Say hello to a centralised, accurate, single view of your customers and prospects!</p>
				<p>You know that there are often multiple sources of customer and prospect data in your organization, a challenge for marketers looking to improve campaign effectiveness and a high degree of segmentation. At CRM Technologies, we take a holistic view of data using Master Data Management (MDM). MDM is an approach that allows you to align data across the enterprise and, when blended with other sources of enterprise customers data, moves you towards a single customer view sitting on a data management platform.</p>
