We’re Platinum Sponsors of the event this year, taking place on 21st and 22nd October, and will be on Stand 1 to discuss marketing automation and the journey to successful sales alignment, demand generation and revenue growth.

Greg Wilson, European Demand Generation & Marketing Operations Manager at our client Canon Europe, will be presenting at 11:20am on Tuesday 21st, discussing “An intelligent approach to marketing automation adoption”. In this session Greg will look at how CRM Technologies helped Canon Europe roll out of their Marketing Automation initiative across 23 countries and used it as a catalyst for change. This will cover the start of the journey, technology implementation, changing processes, adopting a Demand Centre approach and achieving Sales engagement and buy-in.

We’d be delighted to hear from others that are attending. We’ll be tweeting from [@CRMTechnologies](http://www.twitter.com/CRMTechnologies), so do keep an eye on the stream and get in touch if you’re there too. We’re also having a prize draw on our stand for an Apple Watch, so make sure you come by and say hello!
