It’s now less than a week until the CRM Technologies team head out to Nashville for the SiriusDecisions 2015 Summit. This year’s event theme is Outperform: Strategies for Intelligent Growth™ , an ideal fit for our own focus on driving global marketing excellence and one which we’re sure will generate great debate, discussion and networking opportunities.

We’re silver sponsors of the event this year, taking place May 12-15, and will be exhibiting on stand 209. We’d love to share the discussions on driving growth and excellence across sales and marketing with you, so if you’re heading to the Summit, make sure you stop by!

As well as helping you to plot your course towards global marketing excellence, there’s another key topic we’d like to chat to you about: selfies!

No event in Nashville would be complete without some light-hearted entertainment, so come and see us to collect your CRM Technologies selfie stick and get snapping! We’ll be giving away an Apple Watch Sport to the best selfie tweeted during the show with the #CRMselfie hashtag.

Keep an eye on our Twitter stream for more details, [@CRMTechnologies](http://www.twitter.com/crmtechnologies), and get in touch if you’re heading to Nashville too – we’d love to hear from you.
