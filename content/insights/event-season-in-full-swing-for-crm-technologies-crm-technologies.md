We’re delighted to announce that we will be sponsoring the [Marketo Marketing Nation Roadshow](http://pages2.marketo.com/marketing-nation-roadshow-2014-international.html) in London on the 16thSeptember, an event that promises to “Help innovative marketers like you to take your marketing to the next level!”. This is a free to attend event and we’ll be exhibiting on Stand 5 – we’d love to meet you and discuss your marketing automation challenges.

A little further down the line we’ll be gold sponsors of Oracle’s European Modern Marketing Experience (14th-16th October) and platinum sponsors of Sirius Decisions Summit Europe (21st-22nd October). We’ll be exhibiting and speaking at both events, presenting some of our customer case studies that will help demonstrate the way in which businesses are using marketing automation to transform their lead generation programmes.

If you’re planning to attend any of these events, let us know! We’ll be tweeting about them all from [@CRMTechnologies](http://www.twitter.com/CRMTechnologies), so keep an eye on our stream for news and updates.
