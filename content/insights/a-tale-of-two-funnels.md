Last month was packed with funnel-oriented events, looking in depth at issues surrounding sales and marketing alignment, pipeline measurement and those all-important tips to achieving truly measurable ROI from marketing investment.

E-consultancy's [Funnel](http://econsultancy.com/uk/funnel) event at the Emirates Stadium kicked off proceedings (pardon the pun!) with an agenda packed with rich content split into four streams for maximum focus. There were some great insights shared by vendors and consultancies alike, with a very active Twitter feed debating and discussing the merits of each session. The general consensus seemed to be that there were interesting tips, but more real world case studies were needed, more specifics on how businesses achieved some of the results they shared.

[Sirius Decisions](http://www.siriusdecisions.com/)' European summit followed, with further insight into their waterfall approach (a variation on the funnel). Great case studies were shared and lots of peer to peer discussion shed light on some marketing truths about how well organisations are currently implementing sales and marketing alignment (getting there, but still a way to go) and also regarding what tactics are working best. Sirius Decisions' Group Director, Data-Driven Marketing, Meg Heuer [blogged](http://www.siriusdecisions.com/blog/six-thoughts-from-siriusdecisions-summit-europe-2012/) about some key takeaways from the event, two of which we see as being critical for the development of successful marketing automation programmes.

The first is the ever-important content: the white paper may be 'dead' in terms of traditional white paper campaigns, but quality, compelling content that drives people to the top of the funnel is essential for long-term success. The second looks at how important it is to take account of local differences. This is not simply language issues, but the far more subtle and complicated cultural differences in behaviour and which approach works best. Marketers ignore these subtleties at their peril, making local territory experience an important consideration when developing compelling campaigns.

As we approach the end of 2012, these events help us to reflect on what the key issues in marketing automation might be in 2013. There was a general feeling that savvy marketers now 'get' the funnel and don't need to dwell so heavily on the process of making the most of their current pipeline. Those with some marketing automation experience under their belts will be looking to the top of the funnel in 2013, exploring ways of increasing the pipeline of opportunities by attracting a higher volume of new enquiries. The process of scoring and nurturing for many is now becoming familiar, but using the traditional AIDA model (Attract, Interest, Desire, Action) there is still some way to go on the first port of call, 'attract'. With competition for attention at an all-time high, there should be some interesting content campaigns afoot in 2013...
