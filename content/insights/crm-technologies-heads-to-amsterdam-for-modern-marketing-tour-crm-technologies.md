We’re very proud sponsors of the event and our Solutions Consultant Adrian Mills will be presenting at 1:30pm on the ‘Marketing Execution’ track.

Adrian’s session will look at how to leverage some of the vast array of cloud apps to maximise your content and make the most of data capture opportunities, with practical examples of using Eloqua Appcloud apps to boost marketing campaigns, focusing on Normalator, Vidyard and Demandbase. He’ll also be presenting case studies from some of our clients.

Let us know if you’re coming along too, we’d love to say hello!
