We’re proud to announce that we’ll be gold sponsors of [Oracle’s European Modern Marketing Experience](http://www.cvent.com/events/modern-marketing-experience-europe/event-summary-cd2f7509fa4d446aaa38beb82e08c564.aspx?r=d0b1a259-453a-4c69-b5d4-7b2d81f6f3fd) (14th-16th October) and platinum sponsors of [Sirius Decisions Summit Europe](https://www.siriusdecisions.com/Events/Summit/2014-Summit-Europe.aspx) (21st-22nd October). We’ll be exhibiting and speaking at both events, presenting some of our customer case studies that will help demonstrate the way in which businesses are using marketing automation to transform their lead generation programmes. Watch this space for more details.

With Oracle promising ‘an even bigger and better Eloqua Experience’ and the Sirius Decisions Summit focusing on ‘transformation’ as a key theme, we’re looking forward to being involved in the latest industry debates that are shaping the Marketing Cloud, meeting marketers from around the globe, and finding out what hot topics emerge from both events.

If you’re coming along too, let us know! Join us for a networking drink (more details to be announced shortly) or catch one of our presentations. In the meantime, keep an eye on our Twitter feed ([@CRMTechnologies](http://www.twitter.com/CRMTechnologies)) as we’ll be tweeting about both events in the run up to October.
