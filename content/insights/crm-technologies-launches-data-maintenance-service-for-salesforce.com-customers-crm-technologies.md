Specifically targeted at organisations that build and operate marketing databases using multiple, segmented and regularly-updated data sources, CRM’s service is designed to provide users with a 100% valid, up to date data set combining maximum record quality with optimum data integrity.

According to CRM, the new service was developed in response to customers whose marketing data was struggling to maintain parity with the dynamic nature of today’s business environment. “Salesforce.com remains a hugely popular database marketing tool for many technology businesses – but as with any database, the quality of campaign responses depend entirely on the quality of data you start with,” commented CRM Technologies director, Andrew Freeman. “Combine this with the need to introduce regular updates, increasingly segmented or specialist information into your data set and you are faced with a monumental task of maintaining effective data integrity,” he added.

CRM Technologies’ data maintenance service takes raw marketing data, which customers may have drawn from a number of different or disparate sources, and removes all duplication and data inconsistencies via a combination of both automatic and manual review before returning it to the customer as a single, merged and de-duplicated data set. According to CRM, using a combination of automated and manual intervention ensures that data is fully-serviced and returned in a logical and usable condition.

“There are so many possibilities for error within a typical data set that it is highly unlikely that a software-only based cleaning process will cope effectively,” continued Freeman. “Consequently, much of our cleaning process takes the form of manual review of data records – which is invariably the only way to be 100% certain that the data we return is both valid and 100% robust.”

Alan Edwards, marketing director at supply chain software solutions business Manhattan Associates confirms the value of maintaining a regularly-updated and cleaned data set. “At Manhattan, all of our marketing is driven through Salesforce.com and being able to benchmark and verify our marketing data in this environment is absolutely critical,” he commented. “We source a wide range of data types from a number of suppliers and maintaining robust data is vital in the achievement of credible campaign success rates. CRM Technologies provides us with a periodic data cleaning service which not only ensures that our campaigns remain effective, it provides us with a third-party ‘control’ element which ensures that our marketing database remains both compliant and fully-capable of meeting the demands we place upon it,” he added.

As a salesforce.com consultancy and application exchange partner, CRM Technologies can offer bespoke application development services for existing customers of salesforce.com, while offering new salesforce.com users the opportunity to deploy completely customised applications which perfectly match their business needs.

Saleforce.com is one of the pioneers of ‘software as a service’ (SaaS) and its templated, ‘on-demand’ marketing applications delivered over the internet have historically been highly popular with small to medium sized businesses who do not wish to make long term, expensive licensing commitments to major marketing software vendors.

“CRM already has a strong history of delivering hosted and custom-built marketing applications including hosted databases, campaign landing pages and management portals,” added Freeman. “We are confident that the further innovations we will be able to offer through the salesforce model will significantly add to our ability to provide genuine, real-world value to our customers’ marketing activities.”
