So a huge congratulations to them! We have been working with Basware for nearly four years, handling their Eloqua on-boarding and CRM integration and retained to provide on-going support to their sales and marketing organisation.

Eloqua’s marketing awards, or Markies, formally recognise and honour excellence in marketing. Winners will be announced on 25th June at Eloqua Experience Europe, where Basware will also be presenting a session on ‘Plugging (holes in) a Leaky Funnel’.

The full list of finalists can be seen [here](http://markies.eloqua.com/). Best of luck to all those nominated!
