The [DataStart service](http://now.eloqua.com/e/er.aspx?s=1010&lid=43&elq=%3Cspan%20class=eloquaemail%3Erecipientid%3C/span%3E) has been designed to get an organisations marketing data in good shape so that they may take maximum advantage of the targetting and personalisation capabilities of Eloqua.

The [SmartAssist service](http://now.eloqua.com/e/er.aspx?s=1010&lid=42&elq=%3Cspan%20class=eloquaemail%3Erecipientid%3C/span%3E) has been designed to support an organisation in the early stages of adoption to ensure it takes maximum advantage of the power and flexibity that the Eloqua system provides.

Both DataStart and SmartAssist are designed to complement the [SmartStart](http://now.eloqua.com/e/er.aspx?s=1010&lid=44&elq=%3Cspan%20class=eloquaemail%3Erecipientid%3C/span%3E) service that CRM also provide for Eloqua implementations.
