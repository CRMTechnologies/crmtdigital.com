CRM Technologies’ client, TalkTalk Business is a business broadband, telephone, mobile phone and IT support provider. TalkTalk Business were an early adopter of marketing automation technology, however, they recognised that in order to really execute on their strategy for lead generation and conversion they need to take a step back before they could move forward.

In this session, Nick from TalkTalk Business will discuss why they instigated the “LIP” initiative, the approach they took and the challenges they faced in moving TalkTalk Business to a Best-In-Class modern marketing organisation.

What you will learn:

* Why executive sponsorship at the highest level is important and how to get it
* How to agree, design and create a solid end-to-end Lead Management Process
* How to move marketing towards a buyer's journey based model

“_The role of the CRM Manager is to build and utilise analysis of our customer base in order to drive new customer acquisition, customer upsell, cross-sell and customer retention. The role demands that we segment our customer base and prospect market, allowing us to implement differing strategies based on the size and the demands of a business in the marketplace. A key element of the execution of this strategy is how we utilise Eloqua to assist driving new opportunities, communicate effectively and ensure a co-ordinated and structured customer journey._”
