You’d be hard pressed to find a Sales or Marketing professional who doesn’t think that closer alignment between their two functions is now essential to commercial success.

It might be a little early to consign the notion of two silos managing - at best - an uneasy truce in the interests of collaboration and progress to the history books.

## A single aim

But in terms of sales enablement best practices, there is widespread recognition that overcoming traditional differences and conflicts is essential in an age when their common goal has never been clearer: to extract maximum value and profit at every point of engagement throughout a customer experience which has never been as interactive and digitised as it is today.

Yet it is also easy to take the technical considerations behind true alignment for granted. The mere existence of a CRM or MAP system within an organisation doesn’t automatically lead to sales enablement.

## The shared principle

In an insightful post proposing a [two-sided silver bullet for alignment](http://chiefmartec.com/2015/04/new-approach-challenge-salesmarketing-alignment/), marketing blogger Scott Brinker says that Sales and Marketing don’t just need data for its own sake; they need a common dataset with context, captured from the customer at every interactive touchpoint.

“As software drives more and more of the touchpoints between buyers, marketers and salespeople, we have new opportunities to connect those pieces into more cohesive, multi-sided objects,” he writes.

But those objects also depend on the establishment of commonly agreed and understood metrics. If Sales and Marketing are to align, automation must be preceded by agreement on a comprehensive range of metrics, from lead generation to SLAs and KPIs.

## Best practice: the truth

In [Oracle’s](https://www.oracle.com/marketingcloud/resources/sales-marketing-alignment.html) view, this amounts to arriving at a shared set of metrics which define the Sales/Marketing pipeline – and “a single view of the truth” - basic best practice for any organisation building an effective sales enablement strategy.

According to Oracle, integrating your commerce and marketing platforms enables Sales by involving Marketing in the creation of transactional communications and “stamping them with your brand”.

Of course, the software giant recommends choosing two systems designed for integration, rather than linking disparate systems via complex middleware coding.

But what if you aren’t in the happy position of starting from scratch? Successful alignment could come down to implementing a dashboard which centres entirely on your shared metrics.

Agree on these, then automate, is the advice from marketing writer Lisa Canon in her post for [Act-On](http://blog.act-on.com/2015/07/successful-sales-and-marketing-alignment-part-1-get-started/), which offers ten steps for successful sales and marketing cooperation.

The premise that automation is a sales enablement best practice way to remove traditional Sales/Marketing friction throughout the lead generation and management cycle is driven home by [Salesforce](http://www.salesforce.com/uk/socialsuccess/social-media-marketing/sales-and-marketing-alignment.jsp), which suggests that the CRM dashboard is the natural place for both functions to unite around commonly-agreed metrics.

## Which metrics?

What should those metrics be? Every organisation is unique, and it is up to Sales and Marketing leaders to collaborate on a short-list, then track them consistently.

Salesforce has come up with [eight metrics that matter](https://www.salesforce.com/uk/blog/2015/07/sales-marketing-alignment-metrics.html) – the top three of which focus on Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs):

*   The percentage of MQLs that become Sales Accepted Leads

*   The ratio of MQL-to-opportunity – crucial to building a mutual understanding of Sales’ and Marketing’s respective ability to deliver

*   MQL-to-revenue ratio – demonstrating marketing’s contribution to top-line sales.

## Building a framework

System integration is a key technical consideration for any organisation looking to establish sales enablement best practices.

Senior research associate Andrew Moravick says there are three essential requirements to be addressed by Sales and Marketing decision-makers when it comes to alignment:

*   Agree and establish consistent lead stages – and clearly define what distinguishes a conversion between stages

*   Ensure content is tracked by a MAP, or hosted by a fully integrated content management or digital asset management system so that stage-by-stage conversions are recorded

*   Optimise your MAP’s integration with the CRM system and other lead management technology to ensure a seamless data exchange between Sales and Marketing.

## Takeaways

*   Start with your metrics: agree on what you’re going to measure, and build a unified tracking strategy.
*   Build your dashboard around shared KPIs that reflect the shared goals of Sales and Marketing.
*   Embrace the disruption of digital content - and integrate systems to extract maximum value from every interaction, for Sales and Marketing.
