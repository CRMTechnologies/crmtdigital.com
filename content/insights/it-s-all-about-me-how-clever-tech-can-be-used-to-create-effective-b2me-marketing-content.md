Appealing to the individual behind the job title is something that marketers have always sought to achieve. Just recently this method has been given the snappy name of ‘B2Me Marketing’, suggesting that the distinctions between B2C and B2B marketing are irrelevant and the focus should be more on creating an individual and personalised experience for your target audience. This can be very difficult to achieve, but thankfully there’s some great technology available that makes personalised, reactive in-bound marketing content a reality.

In November 2012 we became the first EMEA partner of the personalisation and targeting platform DemandBase. Essentially DemandBase is a reference database that has IP address mapping in front of it. It relies on the fact that most businesses have specific IP addresses and performs a lookup in real time as visitors land on the website. Information is then returned from the database about the company the prospect is visiting from, including profile information such as industry and size of business.

Because this lookup is happening in real time we have the opportunity to personalise web content at the time it is rendered. If, for example, the visitor is a current client, you may want to display contact details for their specific account manager. Alternatively, if a prospect visits the website from a publishing company, you may want to bring specific content and case studies relating to that sector to the front and centre to make the experience more relevant.

Using DemandBase in this way means that no matter how big the customer base, a tailored experience can be delivered from a single landing page. There was an interesting blog post on the [Plotting Success](http://plotting-success.softwareadvice.com/how-docusign-targets-1-billion-leads-0214/) website about DocuSign and how they used DemandBase to deliver a targeted experience for a potential market of approximately one billion people. They claim that by using DemandBase they were able to present the visitor with tailored information in fewer than 100 milliseconds. They used the tool to change homepage signage according to industry, dictate free product trial offerings dependant on company size and enter leads into industry-specific nurturing programs.

Effective B2Me marketing is clearly more complex than simply displaying personalised content ; it’s a two-way procedure that actually shifts the entire lead nurturing process by capturing business profile information early on and splitting out leads across separate nurturing programs defined by any number of variables. Interestingly in the DocuSign example they also found that the sales and marketing relationship had improved thanks to more in depth metrics. Sales teams began to stop questioning the marketing process as they could easily track leads through the course of the pipeline.

This is really just a snap-shot of B2Me marketing and we’ve only scratched the surface of the possibilities of IP responsive content, but it’s clearly a powerful tool that marketers should be doing more with. It’ll be exciting to see what the next step is, but ultimately it all reaffirms what we have been talking about for years in terms of right content, at the right time, to the right person as the formula for successful marketing automation.
