CRM Technologies spoke to Kristen Petersen, Director, Demand Center & Marketing Operations at F5 to find out about her marketing automation journey with CRM Technologies.

## When did you first start working with CRM Technologies and what prompted you to seek assistance at that time?

> “We first started working with CRM Technologies in 2010. We had implemented Neolane as a marketing automation platform across North America and were looking to roll this out across multiple territories in EMEA and APAC. With a limited marketing resource in EMEA, we were looking to find a trusted, expert partner who could assist with this significant project. CRM Technologies were a Neolane approved partner and we opted to leverage their expertise.”
>
> “Following a successful global roll-out of Neolane, we continued to work with CRM Technologies as an additional resource to extend the marketing operations function. After a couple of years, we wanted to take stock of our marketing automation activity and took the opportunity to review our platform of choice. The platform-independent, expert advice from CRM Technologies was extremely valuable to us at that time. We were able to take an objective view of a range of alternative platforms and they assisted in the evaluation according to our specific needs as they had grown to know our business well. With their assistance, we migrated to Marketo.”

## How did CRM Technologies’ expertise help F5?

> “CRM Technologies brought a lot to the table. They educated us with regard to the more complex areas of marketing automation such as lead scoring, helping us to develop a sophisticated lead scoring system which has continued to evolve so that we are now on version 3.0. With their expert assistance, we have now reached the point where we are looking at dynamic scoring and predictive behaviour, much more sophisticated marketing automation which adds real value to our business.”
>
> “Not only has the external perspective offered by CRM Technologies been invaluable, but also their technical skill-set has been an important resource for F5. We are marketers, not technical specialists in CSS, Javascript or coding, so when we see that there is something that needs a more technical approach to improve it, we know we can rely on CRM Technologies.”

## Are there any specific examples of recent successful campaigns with CRM Technologies?

> “We use CRM Technologies’ SmartAssist retainer package which works well in providing extra expert resource at F5. They have delivered numerous successful campaigns in addition to offering technical expertise on specific jobs. Some examples of where they have assisted include creating an appointment calendar for sales meetings at trade shows within the marketing automation system, building a dynamic email campaign based on criteria selected by users on our landing page which offered options of up to 11 papers from a single email. In EMEA, CRM Technologies undertook the front end research into compliance with the new EU privacy laws which was a critical aspect of our successful programmes in that region.”

## Where do you think CRM Technologies has made a difference to your business?

> “CRM Technologies have become an extension of the F5 team. In EMEA, they are my second marketing ops person to offload to when we need to deliver campaigns. In the longer term, CRM Technologies have helped to create a roadmap for our marketing automation journey, helping us to evolve as our knowledge increases and our business requirements change.”

## How do you plan to develop your marketing automation in the future?

> “We will be redeveloping our website and are focused on making it the number one demand generation resource within F5. It is comforting to know that we have a team at CRM Technologies who understands our business and can assist with delivering this.”

## If you could highlight one key benefit of working with CRM Technologies, what would that be?

> “The team is extremely responsive and with expert knowledge. We are based in the USA and they are in London but this has never been an issue at all. If I have any queries, I can send an email and the work is usually done overnight, no problem at all.”
