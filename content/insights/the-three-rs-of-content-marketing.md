Re-use, Re-purpose, Re-write

We all know that if a content marketing programme is firing on all cylinders and well implemented, it will deliver results. What is key here is understanding the type of content that will appeal to each of your buyer personas and mapping each piece accordingly. This is the strategic approach, but for this to be successful a practical approach is also required – the machine needs to be running and quality content needs to be churned out.

Producing regular content is often easier said than done, especially with the distraction of other marketing commitments. It’s important to make the most of what you have and remember that a piece of content can be more than a stand-alone asset. If we use the example of a white paper, following the three ‘Rs’ below will demonstrate just how much mileage can be achieved from one article:

## Re-use:

Producing a gated white paper (or any other content for that matter) for your website is fairly common practice. White papers in particular can be time-consuming to produce, so think about how they can be re-used elsewhere to get the most benefit. Trade shows could be a great opportunity for this, using the article as a catalyst to get people on your stand. Perhaps the paper could also be integrated into your email marketing campaigns.

## Re-purpose:

More often than not white papers will be large, in-depth documents. This is great for those that require this extent of information, but it could also be re-purposed into more digestible chunks. Perhaps, with a little work, some individual chapters could become blog posts, or condensed further into tweet-sized snippets. You could even consider extracting the core takeaways from the white paper and matching them up with some images to create a SlideShare presentation.

## Re-write:

Does the white paper open up another angle that could be investigated in the future? Perhaps you could re-write parts of the paper and turn it into a serialised piece of content. Alternatively you could take the same theme, but re-write from the perspective of a different buyer persona, coming at the issue from a different angle.

Remember that these methods don’t just need to be applied to new content – it may be beneficial to take a look back through previous pieces to determine how you can make more of them (so long as they are still relevant). As mentioned previously, the strategic side of content marketing is as important as the practical side so for tips on mapping your content check out our ‘Are you getting the most mileage from your content?’ blog post.
