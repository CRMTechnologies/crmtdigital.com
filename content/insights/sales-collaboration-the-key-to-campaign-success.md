In a world where the customer journey often takes place entirely online, buyers are now better informed about their purchase than ever before. They can hit the buy button at any point on their journey and, in an increasingly mobile environment, on any device.

Marketing has responded to this shift by embedding calls to action and incentives throughout ever more integrated campaigns. But with every campaign stage offering a potential point of sale, it’s ironic that Sales is the operation that frequently ends up feeling out on a limb – just at a time when organisations have a golden opportunity to pull together to maximise the value of every customer.

## Collaboration culture shock

Collaboration – not just between Marketing and Sales, but across product development and service delivery – is the future. Not in the traditional internal style, with each operation ultimately focused on safeguarding its own domain, but in a unified model that delivers a common understanding of the 21st century buyer’s journey – and is focused on discovering new ways to improve that journey at every touch-point. That could require a significant change in culture.

In a recent [blog post](http://www.business2community.com/marketing/marketing-sales-alignment-integration-collaboration-01136717#1dUAes64lGfkkzVl.97) for Business 2 Community, Marketing Outfield CEO, Dave Hubbard, likened the current situation to a relay team; Sales and Marketing are running in the same race but never at the same time and there is too much scope for dropping the baton at the vital point of exchange.

Hubbard says that if Sales and Marketing had a common understanding of the buyer’s journey, the business could realise three key benefits:

* Create content to support the journey across different stages
* Capture (and therefore use) the knowledge of buyer behaviour at every stage
* Build campaigns that effectively allow leads to self-qualify as they become more knowledgeable about their prospective purchase.

## More than technology

Of course all of this can be done with technology – today’s sales-focused CRM systems are geared to capturing all the information necessary to create intuitive campaigns with a strong emphasis on sales conversion.

But too often, just at a point where Sales has the most to contribute in terms of customer knowledge and up-selling potential, it is sidelined by the burden of non-selling processes and administration rather than being engaged with marketing – and Marketing’s failure to tap into its knowledge base.

Recruitment consultancy Randstad’s recent [Sales and Marketing Alignment](https://www.randstad.co.uk/employers/sales-marketing-alignment-report/) report confirmed that Marketing and Sales collaboration is still a work in progress for many businesses. It discovered that while 77% of sales professionals think their own function is leveraging data to form better customer relationships, 37% believe their marketing colleagues are failing to do so.

Less than half think Marketing is concerned with generating ROI, and nearly 20% don’t consider marketers to be as market-aware and focused with demand-generating campaigns as they should be.

However, the report does suggest that sales collaboration is improving. Slowly. With industry watchers issuing a rallying cry to bring everyone who holds a stake in the customer journey together – and to give sales access to the resources, apps, technology and processes that will enable them to sell more effectively throughout the journey – the incentives are clear.

## Bridging the gap

Research from Aberdeen Group suggests that one way to [bridge the gap](http://v1.aberdeen.com/launch/report/knowledge_brief/9328-KB-service-sales-collaboration.asp) is for Sales and post-sale services to work closer together, enabling the business to leverage the opportunities that come from a better understanding of the customer.

And Salesforce’s [State of Marketing 2015](https://www.salesforce.com/form/marketingcloud/2015-state-of-marketing.jsp) report urges organisations to step away from lifecycle marketing and focus on the individual customer journey. With 86% of senior-level marketers agreeing that it’s vital to create a cohesive journey, and concerns about lead quality are still one of the top three challenges faced by marketing (along with new business development and keeping up to date with technology), collaboration has to be the best way forward.

If you can bring sales, product and service teams together to build a complete view of your customer’s interaction with your brand – which includes identifying the gaps and poor experiences – it can only help your campaigns to be even more focused and successful.

## Takeaway

* Lead by example: get your marketing, sales, product and service teams collaborating around the table
* Forget lifecycle marketing and focus on the complete customer journey
* Invest in technology, apps and resources that will liberate sales to contribute intelligence gathered at the coalface of customer engagement
