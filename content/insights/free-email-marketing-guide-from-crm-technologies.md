This free email-marketing guide is aimed at marketing professionals working in both B2B and B2C environments. The guide provides hints and tips to help the effective and compliant execution of email-marketing campaigns within the most recent legal guidelines.

“It covers the fundamental aspects of every email-marketing campaign,” explains Andrew Freeman, Director at CRM Technologies Ltd. “From avoiding the ‘spam’ label and maintaining credibility, to handling responses and analysing failure. Most importantly though, it also details a pre-campaign checklist of legal requirements related specifically to email-marketing. Our own market research indicates worryingly high levels of ignorance and apathy among senior marketing professionals about the legislation that came into effect last autumn. It seems to have generated a great deal of confusion.”

According to a recent CRM Technologies Ltd survey, marketing professionals did not understand the new email-marketing legislation, and were likely to ignore it in practice. New rules require all B2C email recipients to opt in to receive email-marketing, while B2B recipients only require an easy and free opt-out clause. However, roughly one in eight marketing professionals said they had never heard of the new legislation relating to email communications, and another third (37%) said they were not sure about the detail of it.

Entitled “Achieving ROI on Marketing Spend”, the report surveyed over 100 heads of marketing in £50m-plus-turnover businesses. The email-marketing Guide is designed to tackle these issues, and more. It also discusses the virtues of plain-text versus HTML formats, and explains how to adopt an integrated approach to marketing via email.
