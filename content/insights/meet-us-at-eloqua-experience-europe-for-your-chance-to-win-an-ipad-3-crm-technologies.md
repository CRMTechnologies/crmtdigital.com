We are looking forward to an excellent line up this year, especially the keynote from David Meerman Scott, Author of The New Rules of Marketing and PR, not to mention the first ever European Markies! (register [here](https://www.oracle.com/marketingcloud/about/events.html) if you haven’t already..).

We have lots of exciting news about developments here at CRM Technologies (more on those soon…) and would love to meet up with you at the conference. Drop by our stand in the foyer and be in with a chance to win an iPad 3 (you know you want to!). We’ll even let you in on some of new developments, including our very own Eloqua app cloud connector Normalator.

As the Social Media sponsor of Eloqua Experience Europe 12, we would like to know what are you looking forward to most? Tweet us on [@CRMTechnologies](https://twitter.com/crmtechnologies) or write on our Facebook wall at [facebook/crmtechnologies](https://www.facebook.com/crmtechnologies).

We look forward to seeing you and remember to bring along your business card and drop by our stand to enter our free prize draw for an iPad3.
