Events and trends

We regularly have a packed events calendar and 2014 was no exception – in fact we’re not long back from the B2B Marketing Awards. The sheer number of events that focus on Marketing Automation, either entirely or in part, goes to show just how much interest and hunger there is among marketing professionals to keep up with Marketing Automation developments and to understand how they can make the most out of ever more sophisticated systems.

One of the first events we attended this year was Technology for Marketing and Advertising (TFM&A). The reason this event stood out is the noticeable consolidation of promotion and messaging coming from the big three vendors (Oracle, Adobe and Salesforce) when it came to the Marketing Cloud. Clearly marketers are looking for more than just Marketing Automation - they want social media, content and data all under one roof and the vendors are responding to this with comprehensive cloud offerings. With very similar messages coming from all vendors in this space, it can be a confusing environment for those in the platform selection process. Interestingly though this hasn’t deterred organisations from investing in Marketing Automation, and we’re seeing a growing maturity of understanding about MA capabilities from the clients we work with.

At the end of 2013, a [Forrester report](https://www.forrester.com/Gauging+Your+Progress+And+Success/fulltext/-/E-RES95303) concluded that 58 percent of all top performing companies were using marketing automation, with the figure expected to grow exponentially throughout 2014. The benefits of automation can’t be ignored in the current marketing landscape, a fact that organisations are becoming increasingly aware of. The expectations of customers has shifted – a one size fits all approach to marketing doesn’t cut it anymore and the only way to successfully introduce personalised marketing is with automation.

## Achievements

We want to use this opportunity to congratulate our clients and partners that have excelled in the Marketing Automation space this year.

We were delighted to share the stage with McAfee’s Jeff Breyare at Eloqua’s Modern Marketing Experience in October to discuss the large data project we’d delivered, an event that also featured presentations from our clients Basware and Microfocus. All of these organisations are at the top of their marketing automation game and most importantly have shared their knowledge with their peers at industry events this year.

We were also proud to stand alongside Greg Wilson from Canon Europe at the Sirius Decisions Summit in the same month, showcasing the challenges and successes of rolling out Marketing Automation across 23 countries through a Demand Centre led approach.

Our clients across the globe are regularly recognised for their achievements, and we’re proud to have helped them on their road to Marketing Automation success. We look forward to continuing the journey with them as we enter 2015 – a year that is sure to bring a new set of challenges, so keep an eye out for our predictions, coming soon!
