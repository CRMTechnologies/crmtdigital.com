Andrew Freeman, CEO of CRM Technologies, said: “We are delighted to welcome Sean on board at a critical time for the business. Along with Paul Lee, who joined earlier this year, and our other senior management team members, Sean will help drive deeper growth into our existing customer base. With his strong background in operations and programme management, Sean is the ideal person to head up our highly experienced digital delivery teams and to broaden the skillset we offer to our clients.”

Sean has over a decade’s experience of delivering digital consultancy and professional services to businesses. He has extensive knowledge of the marketing automation and sales automation markets, having previously held positions at Oracle/Eloqua, Microsoft and Teradata.

Sean commented: “This is the perfect time to be joining CRM Technologies and I’m looking forward to working with the team to drive continued organic growth. The marketing automation industry is on an upward curve and it’s great to be part of a team that’s at the heart of this evolution.”
