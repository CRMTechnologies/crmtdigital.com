As of 1st July 2014, businesses and organisations are banned from sending commercial electronic messages (texts, emails and social media messages) to recipients in Canada without their approval under Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation. With potential fines in the region of $10 million this is already having a dramatic impact on global email marketers.

While anti-spam legislation has been in force in many European territories for some time, the Canadian legislation has the potential to cause a headache for any marketers with Canadian contacts in their database.

All is not lost however! Thankfully a three year grace period has been established, postponing any legal action from individuals to 2017. To relieve the pressure further we’ve outlined a few survival tips:

* Don’t forget that the new legislation could actually result in a smaller, more manageable and accurate database that’s more effective. As you run through your database and attempt to reactivate customers you may see some older contacts coming back to life. (See our ‘[Waking The Dead](https://www.crmtechnologies.com/blog/2013/03/21/waking-the-dead-reviving-emotional-unsubscribes/)’ post for tips on this)
* Where appropriate, offer an incentive to customers that opt-in. You’ll need to do all you can to encourage people to take that extra step, so think creatively!
* You can still rely on implicit consent. While it’s a good idea to run campaigns to get explicit consent from your database, an important section of the new legislation reads as follows: “If the email recipient has bought something from you in the last 2 years, or expressed an interest in your company in the last six months, you have implicit consent.”
* Don’t simply assume all your Canadian contacts will have a ‘.ca’ email address. It may be necessary to use an IP look-up to establish who is based in Canada (and if you’re not doing this already, we can help you in this area).
* Retain records of all consent confirmations.
* In order to be compliant, all messages sent must include your name, the person on whose behalf you are sending (if applicable), your physical mailing address and your telephone number, email address, or website.
* Any subsequent messages sent to your opt-in list must include an unsubscribe option and unsubscribes must be dealt with within ten days.

While this list is not exhaustive, and of course you must check details of the legislation carefully before you undertake any campaigns, it should serve as a useful ‘quick check’ reminder as you get to grips with how the new laws may affect your business.

We know that the introduction of new legislation always causes upheaval for marketers, and the ripples can be felt for some time afterwards – but you can also see this as a positive opportunity to reassess your campaigns and create new, targeted incentives for stronger demand generation in the long term.
