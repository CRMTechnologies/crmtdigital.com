CRM Technologies Ltd has further broadened its expertise within the CRM arena with its appointment as a Microsoft CRM Certified Software Advisor. The company has also announced its intention to bring CRM solutions and services to a wider range of businesses than ever before.

Microsoft CRM is a comprehensive sales and marketing software solution that helps businesses increase sales success, provide superior customer service, accurately forecast sales and analyse business performance. Accessible through both Microsoft Outlook and the web, Microsoft CRM offers a flexible, scalable architecture that integrates easily with Microsoft Office, Microsoft Business Solutions financial management applications, third-party applications, and a company’s customer-facing web site.

“Building close relationships with experienced, business-focused partners is key to our strategy in taking Microsoft CRM to market. We need partners who understand customer needs and pain points, and who can help them get the most out of our product,” said Michala Alexander, CRM Product Manager, Microsoft Business Solutions. “Microsoft certification is an established benchmark for authenticating product knowledge and technical skills, as well as underlining Microsoft’s public commitment to the channel, and I’m delighted that CRM Technologies Ltd has achieved certification. We are confident they will help our customers achieve real return on their investment.

“As a Microsoft CRM Certified Software Advisor, CRM Technologies Ltd is aiming to bring the benefits of Microsoft’s recently-launched CRM solution to a wide range of small-to-medium-sized businesses and will be offering CRM solutions in a variety of formats including both turn-key and fully-hosted solutions.

“Microsoft CRM certification gives us the opportunity to address many of the barriers which prevent the successful implementation of CRM solutions within many small-to-medium businesses,” commented CRM Technologies Ltd Director, Andrew Freeman. “Issues like capital spend and the technical expertise necessary to support or customise implementations can present huge obstacles to SMEs and Microsoft’s CRM solution, together with our own expertise, will open the CRM marketplace to a much wider audience,” he added.
