We’ll be the headline sponsors of the Demand Generation track, with a speaking slot at 10:35am in which CRM Technologies’ CEO Andrew Freeman will introduce our client Ceri Jones, VP of Demand Generation for Basware Oyj, who will discuss how we assisted Basware in approaching the sales and marketing alignment challenge and ultimately improved Sales Accepted Leads by 136% in 12 months. Key learning points from this session will be defining common challenges in an un-aligned world, how to plug gaps in your lead pipeline, why service level agreements are important and how a common process and definitions drive engagement.

This is the third year that we’ve sponsored the B2B Summit and we’re looking forward to the usual great content and networking. If you’re going too then come and say hello at our stand in the delegate area.
