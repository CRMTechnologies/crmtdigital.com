Marketing operations specialist CRM Technologies has implemented an innovative, closed loop sales, marketing and demand generation system for rapidly-growing software solutions business, Vamosa. According to CRM Technologies, this is the first time that a system with such high levels of functionality and capability has been implemented by them outside of the large, multi-national corporate sector.

CRM Technologies’ solution for Vamosa combines fully-integrated applications from both salesforce.com, one of the world’s most popular customer relationship management packages and Eloqua, a leading developer of automated, online marketing automation and demand generation tools. Both were brought together into a single, closed-loop solution by CRM Technologies following a three-month implementation.

As well as designed and implementing the system for Vamosa, CRM Technologies will also be operating and administering the system on Vamosa’s behalf during the initial stages whilst internal resources are trained to operate the system, providing Vamosa with maximum flexibility and value from the system, right from ‘day one’. CRM also provides on-going operational strategy and data services to Vamosa to ensure the system evolves with changing business requirements and that the data it contains maintains its integrity.

Vamosa, whose customers include Cable & Wireless, Vodafone, IBM, Oracle, and Volkswagen North America, offers automated solutions for ‘Enterprise Content Governance’ to large organisations who wish to extract the maximum return from their online content assets. As a small, but rapidly growing business, Vamosa needed a highly-efficient marketing operations system capable of providing them with effective marketing automation services now, as well as one which could be ‘scaled up’ for growth.

“Our growth plans meant that we needed a fully-featured, closed-loop demand creation and relationship management system capable of running our entire marketing operations process,” commented Vamosa’s VP Marketing, Ceri Jones. CRM Technologies has provided us with a solution and ongoing operational and administrative services which will allow us to continue to reap the benefits of this system for many years to come,” he added.

CRM Technologies’ partnerships with both salesforce.com and Eloqua means that the company can deliver a suite of managed services for existing users, while offering new users the opportunity to deploy completely customised solutions which perfectly match their business needs.

According to CRM Technologies, a system of this capability would previously only have been within the reach of the largest corporations or multi-nationals. However, both Eloqua and Salesforce.com can be delivered ‘on demand’ via the ‘software as a service’ (SaaS) model, which has historically been highly popular with small to medium sized businesses who do not wish to make long term, expensive licensing commitments. As such, when combined with CRM’s own marketing operations and integration expertise, the company can now provide ‘corporate-level’, closed-loop sales and marketing management systems to businesses of almost any size.

“By ‘kick-starting’ the system for Vamosa in this way, we have demonstrated that you no longer need to be a large corporate or multinational in order to implement a high quality marketing and sales operations platform,” commented CRM Technologies Director Andrew Freeman. “The market for ‘on demand’ software applications is growing quickly as businesses begin to appreciate the convenience and cost advantages of SaaS applications. Correspondingly, the need for effective and intelligent demand creation applications is now greater than ever and our aim is to offer businesses the opportunity to adopt essential demand creation systems which are tailored or specially developed to meet their business needs,” he said.
