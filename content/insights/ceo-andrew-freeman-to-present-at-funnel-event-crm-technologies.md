This year, we are delighted to be attending as premier sponsors and are looking forward to hearing our CEO Andrew Freeman present as part of the Engage stream.

Funnel draws together the leading figures in the so called ‘B2B marketing revolution’ and the event will focus in particular on the alignment of marketing and sales as a tactic to drive new business through the funnel, a process that is supported by a generation of tools and technologies such as Marketing Automation, Lead Nurturing, Campaign Management and Email Marketing, to name just a few.

Andrew’s presentation titled ‘Right Content, Right Person, Right Time’ will be based on our [McAfee case study](http://marketingoperations.crmtechnologies.com/?p=134). We assisted McAfee in the design, implementation and on-going refinement of a nurture programme which has led to a four-fold increase in opportunity conversion, highlighting a clear return on investment. Our fundamental approach was the rationale of taking the prospect on a journey, rather than just talking to them about a product. The success of this strategy was based on the mantra of “sending the right content to the right person at the right time”.

Andrew will be presenting at 11:45am in the Engage stream and do come along and say hello to us at stand 19 if you are heading to FUNNEL too!
