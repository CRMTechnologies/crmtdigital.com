The first issue to be clear on is how the 'dead' or 'emotional unsubscribes' are defined. There is little that is more frustrating to an active user than falling on to the wrong list and receiving irrelevant content, as demonstrated by B2B Marketing who state that 58% of those who stop reading, disengage, or unsubscribe quote a lack of relevance as a key factor. Keep subscribers happy by setting a number of strict filter parameters, the specifics of which may vary depending on the campaign. For example, for an entry to be defined as 'dead' it may need to tick the following boxes:

* Sent at least one email within last 12 months
* Have not opened an email within last 12 months
* Have not clicked an email within last 12 months
* Have not been lead scored within last 12 months
* Have not visited a website within last 12 months
* Have not visited a hypersite within last 12 months
* Have not submitted a form within last 12 months
* Are not bounce back

Once categories have been identified and the filter is in place, a decision needs to be made about the tone of what you send them next. It may be necessary to move straight in with a direct and firm approach giving one more chance to act before removal from the database, or you may decide to take a gradual and gentler approach across a number of emails:

**Email One:**

Subject line: "We've missed you"

**If no action - send email two:**

Subject line: "Let us know if your interests have changed"

**If no action - send email three:**

Subject line: "Keep your subscription active"

Once a decision has been made on the tone and content of your emails, the automated campaign can begin to take shape. In order to find the user’s preferred email format, each should be sent in a different style – email one may be specifically personalised, email two could be marketing and content rich and email three in simple plain text. A sensible amount of time should of course be left between each communication. Responses can be fed directly in to lead scoring and subsequently nurturing.

If this process is adhered to, a strong attempt has been made to ‘prod and persuade’ the user to re-engage. The best result that can be hoped for is that they update their preferences and start receiving content that is of interest to them. For this to be effective, the preference centre needs to be clear, easy to use and quick to complete.
