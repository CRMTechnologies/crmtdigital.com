The average customer, whether in the business-to-business or the consumer market, now has the capacity to be better informed than ever before. In fact, research suggests that almost 60% of the sales process is controlled by the buyer.

Over the years this passing of the mantel has radically shifted marketing activity and sales interaction so much so that in many businesses today, marketing has assumed total control of the entire pre-sales process. And with today’s average sales cycle 22% longer (according to SiriusDecisions), sales have also adapted having had to adopt new skills in listening, interpreting buyer behaviour, interacting at the right time across new channels (including social) and broadening and deepening product knowledge. This radical consumer change is recognised by many of the top performing global organisations and is producing high-performing and tightly aligned sales and marketing teams.

## How does automation help?

Technology for both SFA (Sales Force Automation) and MA (Marketing Automation) have been around for some time and have radically re-shaped sales and marketing activity and alignment. It’s where the two platforms cross-over that can provide the pivot point for sales enablement.

The marketing organisation is in a unique position to help stimulate the sales organisation via the technology it uses to track visitor interaction with the many campaigns, assets and content it publishes across the corporate web estate. One of the many success measures for marketing is the ability to help sales, disseminating knowledge and content are two contributing factors. The ability to collate and aggregate a prospect's activity and measure intent to purchase is highly valuable insight for sales. Now, whilst 60% of the purchase journey is made without sales interaction, sales can experience the journey in parallel, in real-time and engage with relevant information and have a more informed conversation with their prospect.

The challenge is marketing own the technology. The power automation offers is not only in the collation of activity data, providing always-on nurturing ensuring prospects are delivered relevant and timely information throughout their buying experience, but it’s the delivery of this valuable insight into the technology that sales people are comfortable with every day where the magic happens – SFA or CRM.

Helping today’s salesperson deliver the right content, to the right person at the right time to stimulate the buying process is the best example of how modern marketing automation can deliver the goods to sales (it’s also proven to cut average sales cycles). Using scoring further helps to prioritise which leads to contact first based on lead quality and purchase intent. Tracking and alerting tools ensure prospect activity is visible all the time. And finally, having access to a library of content, templated and applicable to various stages of the buying cycle, that’s easily top & tailed to add personalisation, should all now be standard issue in the modern sales tool kit delivered by marketing automation.

## How to do it

Putting sales enablement into practice is actually fairly simple. Admittedly it will be more challenging for larger corporates than smaller organisation but at its core, it’s about communication. Here are six easy steps.

**Share relevant information,** not just the usual lead information but details on prospect’s recent activity.

**Adopt a proven sales technique,** learn from the best reps, use a prescribed sales process such as the SiriusDecision Demand Waterfall.

**Give Sales the tools to execute,** great email templates, great content, great reference material all bundling into an easy to deploy package

**Walk don’t run with Sales Enablement,** start with a small test group and expand over time.

**Make it easy,** sales like this with little detraction from everyday process.

**Take your time and don’t force adoption,** collaborate and shares success and failures (put in a fail fast).

## Takeaways:

*   Sales are no longer the gateholders of information - that role now belongs to the customer.
*   You can no longer afford for your sales and marketing teams to exist in silos.
*   Automation plays a vital part in aligning your sales and marketing teams.
