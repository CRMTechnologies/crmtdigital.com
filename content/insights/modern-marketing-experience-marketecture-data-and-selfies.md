From the conversations the CRM Technologies team were having at the event, we noticed a couple of key themes:

## CRM meets Marketing Automation

This is certainly not a new topic of discussion, but one that seems to have a higher relevance today. We’re seeing a continued rise of the ‘marketing technologist’, with CRM playing an increasing role in the ‘marketecture’.

## Data, Data, Data

Again, data has become a word that’s intrinsically linked with marketing, driving personalisation and the customer journey. From the conversations we had at the show, it seems there is a particular interest in the ways in which the Oracle Marketing Cloud and Oracle Data Centres can help with cross-channel customer experience. (Keep your eyes peeled for a blog post on this very topic soon!)

## #CRMselfie

If you visited our booth at MME, you would have no doubt ended up with your very own CRM Technologies selfie stick. We were encouraging marketers to share their own Vegas-themed #CRMselfie, with an Apple Watch going to the best entry. We’ll be announcing the winner shortly, but for now take a look at some of the great entries below!
