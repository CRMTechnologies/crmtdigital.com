## What?

Broadly speaking, A/B testing is the process of trying out changes on a web page, document, asset or email against the current design to determine the best possible results. By testing two variants at a similar time and to similar readers, marketers and designers will be able to see what performs best in terms of conversion rates – be it click-throughs, downloads, enquiries or any other metrics.

## Why?

**Importance in inbound marketing**

All websites will have a goal in mind. Consumer sites might exist to increase brand exposure, eCommerce sites will be aiming to sell products, while B2B websites could have an entirely different purpose depending on the product or service on offer. The common thread that ties all websites together is the requirement to make the most of web visitors. A considerable amount of time is often applied to the SEO effort, in an attempt to increase web traffic, so the next logical step is to ensure the website is working to its full potential to encourage web visitors to follow the desired behaviours (whether that means sign-ups, click-throughs, downloads etc.). This is where A/B testing comes in.

A/B testing can be applied to any page of a website, or indeed to any of the assets hosted on the site. The specific variations that can be tested are almost limitless, but some general areas to start with could be:

* Headline
* Call To Action
* Images
* Placement of content within a page
* Phrasing of paragraph text

**Importance in outbound marketing**

If a marketing campaign has a specific goal, or set of goals, A/B testing is a great way to test efficiencies. This is especially true of outbound email marketing, where the results in terms of open and click rates will be fairly instantaneous.

Once again, any number of variations can be tested, such as subject line, inclusion of images or personalised content. The areas you test will depend entirely on your goals. If you’re attempting to revive contacts that haven’t interacted with your emails for some time, for example, it may be beneficial to test the tonality of the copy within the emails: direct and to the point, or softer in style and more general. (Take a look at our [Reviving Emotional Unsubscribes](https://www.crmtechnologies.com/blog/2013/03/21/waking-the-dead-reviving-emotional-unsubscribes/) post for more on this.)

## How

There are a number of tools available to assist with A/B testing. For each website visitor A/B testing tools will intermittently swap the items you are testing, providing analytics that will demonstrate success rates (so long as you tell them what success looks like – i.e. what your conversion goal is). If you are testing variations of a whole web page, the tools can redirect some users to the original page, while others will see the new design. For emails, you could choose two subject lines for examples and test these on a sample of your list before committing.

Of the wealth of A/B testing tools available, here are a few that we’ve heard good things about recently:

* [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) – ‘Content Experiments’
* [Optimizely](https://www.optimizely.com/)
* [KISSmetrics](https://www.kissmetrics.com/)
* [Visual Website Optimizer](http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/)
