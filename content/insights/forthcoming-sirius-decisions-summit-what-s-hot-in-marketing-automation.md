In November, the CRM Technologies team will be heading in to London to exhibit at and take part in the [2012 Sirius Decisions Summit Europe](http://www.siriusdecisions.com/live/home/document.php?dA=HomeConference). The invitation only event forms one of a number of 'funnel' oriented events on the marketing calendar, so we decided to take a moment to reflect on the hot topics likely to be on the lips of B2B marketing professionals from across Europe:

* **Sales and marketing alignment** - this age old issue is still an important talking point and in the context of Sirius Decisions, the demand waterfall will be a hot topic. Originally launched in 2006, Sirius Decisions will introduce a revised waterfall, enhanced after years of feedback and input from thousands of B2B clients. It will be interesting to hear some interesting case studies of how the waterfall has been used and adjusted according to business/sector requirements.
* **The customer experience** - the customer is at the heart of everything marketing does, and yet marketing strategies don't always begin with understanding the customer and their needs. In a B2B context and in particular in relation to marketing automation, understanding the customer and the buyer's journey is the very essence of success. Sirius Decisions' own Megan Heuer will share some insights into opportunities for B2B Marketers to evolve their role in architecting the customer experience.
* **Difficult economic conditions and innovation** - As the difficult economic climate continues, innovation is more critical than ever to business growth. Innovation in terms of marketing concepts as well as technologies is something marketers will be looking for if they are to help their business gain competitive advantage. The summit includes sessions on growth and innovation, with some exciting attendees; this could be a truly valuable session.
* **Content** - no matter what the delivery mechanism, social, mobile, email
