Selecting a Marketing Automation platform is no small undertaking. A substantial amount of work should be taking place internally before you can begin to look to the market to see what is available. Eventually, though, you will reach a stage when you’re ready to prepare an RFP. This is a crucial step, so what questions should you be asking?

In the process of formulating a long list you would have no doubt looked at the practical functions each vendor offers. It is easy to get side-tracked by the sales hype, but it is important to focus on how you will use the system to support your processes, not simply what the system can do. Technology is not a solution but an enabler. By thinking this way you should be able to formulate questions that relate to both the functionalities of the product and, more specifically, also to how they will benefit your organisation upon implementation.

The functionalities of the system are hugely important, but when formulating an RFP it is all too easy to forget to include questions relating to the softer elements, such as:

* What other companies my size are using this system?
* What other companies in my industry are using this system?
* What community exists around the product? Is there an active blog or calendar of events?
* What training is available?
* How extensive is the partner network?

Asking these questions will push the vendors’ sales teams to provide information beyond the stock data that they use time and again and hopefully give you an indication of how far they will go to help you to make the most of the system with a strong support network.

Don’t underestimate the importance of the bigger picture at every stage of the process, including at RFP. Swapping to a different vendor further down the line is tough, time consuming and potentially costly, so it is important to find the platform that fits best with your organisation from the outset. The RFP, while only one element of a lengthy process, gives you a great opportunity to do this. Depending on the requirements and size of the company the RFP process could take up to three months, so be prepared to put the leg work in!
