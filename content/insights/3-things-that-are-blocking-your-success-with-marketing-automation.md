Marketing automation is much more than just a technology issue: it is a long-term change of mind set that must be adopted across a business, not just the marketing team. As a strategic rather than tactical move, then, there is no miracle formula to marketing automation, but if you are new to it and need to understand the potential pitfalls you face, check below for our key tips on how to address common roadblocks in marketing automation success.

## Lack of content

If marketing automation is the engine that drives inbound marketing, content is the fuel that keeps it going. There is plentiful research that points to lack of content as being a major challenge facing marketers looking to implement an effective marketing automation programme.

There are a couple of key steps you can take to address this:

* **Content audit** – start by looking at what you already have available and actually create a repository of content in a single place so that you have the big picture. Once you know what content ‘assets’ you have available, you can look at the magic three Rs to make the most of them (read our blog post [here](https://www.crmtechnologies.com/blog/2014/07/24/the-three-%E2%80%98rs%E2%80%99-of-content-marketing/)).
* **Content pipeline** – marketing automation programmes are content hungry so you need a clear process and pipeline of ideas to maintain momentum. For the top of funnel, social media content, blogs and PR can be particularly challenging while the type of content for the middle of your funnel tends to be richer and used more widely, such as case studies and papers, and often takes longer to get together. Creating a clear process for generating and prioritising content is essential to fuel your marketing automation programme and there are a number of platforms designed specifically to assist with this.

## Variety of approach

It’s easy to get caught up in the need to maintain momentum and keep pushing the same approach in your emails for outbound content, but without testing and correction you risk creating emotional unsubscribes – people who don’t even bother opening the email to unsubscribe. Painful though it might be to our pride as marketers, not everyone will respond to our attempts at digital engagement first time around (see [digital dating blog](https://www.crmtechnologies.com/blog/2014/09/20/digital-dating-%E2%80%93-tips-for-building-successful-client-relationships-through-marketing-automation/)). Here are a few tips for mixing it up and generating engagement:

* **A/B testing** – crucial for both inbound and outbound marketing, A/B testing avoids the ‘eggs in one basket’ approach that could be disastrous for expensive campaigns. This can be applied to website content, email marketing, social media, advertising, and any marketing channel available.
* **Optimise everything** – it’s not just the design elements that need to be constantly optimised. Workflows, lead scoring processes and all features of your marketing automation programme need to be continually re-evaluated. Don’t switch on auto-pilot and expect everything to look after itself.

## Poorly defined MQL criteria

The ultimate goal with marketing automation is to deliver qualified leads that the sales team can pick up and convert into hard cash. As the buyer’s journey progresses, the later stage will involve deciding at what point they are qualified enough to pass over to the sales team. Get this wrong at your peril: the sales team will soon lose interest in the leads from marketing and start freestyling when it comes to lead generation. How can you avoid this?

**Agree lead scoring criteria with sales** – aligning the sales and marketing teams at your organisation isn’t always going to be easy (read our post on this very issue [here](https://www.crmtechnologies.com/blog/2014/09/26/4-pillars-of-successful-sales-and-marketing-alignment/)) but it is essential. A fundamental part of this alignment is agreeing how leads will be scored and the exact point at which they will be passed to the sales team.

**Test lead scoring before passing over to the sales team** – once you have agreed scoring criteria, run these for a while and see if they are on the right track before formalising and starting to pass leads over. If you pass them on before you have had a chance to refine scoring criteria, there is a risk that the leads may not be as qualified as you would like and these early ‘poor’ leads might just set the wrong tone in terms of how sales perceive the quality of leads.

Implementing a successful marketing automation programme is an ongoing and strategic process, a journey that needs to constantly be reviewed and refined. Like every long-term commitment, it pays to lay good foundations at the start to set yourself up for success, and then review and adapt on an ongoing basis to maximise your chances of outstanding results.
