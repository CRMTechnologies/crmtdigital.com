The nurturing principle is one that lies at the heart of good marketing automation. Indeed the whole premise is to support and nurture relationships with prospects and customers, albeit digitally, enabling them to progress at their own pace through the buying cycle. But how do you ensure that you build relationships for the long haul? Does digital ‘dating’ your prospects really work?

The plethora of marketing automation tools available to CMOs today and the increased propensity to adopt marketing automation practices would suggest that certainly this longer-term nurturing is possible and in fact essential if you are to keep up with the competition. Digital dating can exponentially increase the scope of nurturing to a much higher volume than using traditional techniques, opening up a world of possibilities in terms of reach and size of customer fan base.

From a CMO perspective, there are several key aspects to consider when developing nurture campaigns using marketing automation:

1. **Keep it personal** – ensuring that your content is personalised according to segmented profile information is absolutely crucial to successfully building and maintaining a relationship (read our ‘B2Me’ blog for more on this). We have all been on the receiving end of an email inviting us to try a product or service when we are already a customer and it doesn’t feel great. Make sure that your data is accurate and current to ensure that personal touch when addressing customers. People buy from people is an old adage, but one that still rings true. If there is a key individual or contact that the customer wants to hear from or receive content from, make it personal from them, not just from the company brand.
2. **Reward loyalty** – keeping tabs on how long a customer has been with you, the range of products and services they have purchased and whether they have given case studies, testimonials or referred business is easier than ever. With solid information on loyalty, you should be in a strong position to highlight those most valuable advocates and reward them accordingly. Marketing automation can help maintain and nurture those relationships through campaigns aimed at rewarding their loyalty, whether through incentive schemes, valuable content or inviting them to special events and more.
3. **Remove the barriers** – gated content certainly serves a valuable purpose in gathering important data to assist with profiling, but when it comes to established customers, putting a barrier up when offering some valuable content may seem like a cold shoulder. Be aware of who is receiving the information and what your relationship is with them before including this. Smart MA can do this with quality data and profiling.

Ultimately marketing automation and other marketing technologies are there as enablers to achieve greater revenue opportunities and greater brand presence. It has always been more cost effective to retain a customer than to acquire a new one and so nurturing loyal and valuable customers through digital dating should be part of your CMO toolkit for the longer term.
