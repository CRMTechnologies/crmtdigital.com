## Big data spending spree

It’s predicted that in 2015, global spend on big data-related software, hardware and services will be [$125 billion](http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS25285614).

## The big question

Who owns the data - Marketing or IT?

## The big answer

IT is the lynchpin of today’s global sales and marketing strategy - and that means an equal share of data ownership across the enterprise.

[“Companies can expect competition to arrive from any angle. The only cure is an obsession with customers, driven from the top by the CIO and CMO.”](http://blogs.forrester.com/cliff_condon/14-12-14-how_the_cmo_and_cio_will_determine_the_future_of_business_in_2015)

_Cliff Condon, Analyst, Forrester_

## The challenge

76% of IT team members say their biggest challenge is [accessing data siloed in various business applications across the enterprise.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2013/01/31/big-data-star-wars-the-cmocio-wars-continue/)

54% of senior marketers [aren’t sure that their marketing technology investments are producing tangible benefits.](http://marketingland.com/creating-martech-strategy-can-pay-big-105544)

## The two must meet

**Interested observer:** How many different marketing technologies are you using to generate results based on live data?

**Marketing specialist:** Erm… \[pause for data mining\] I’m not really sure.

IT holds the interoperability key - and gatecrashing this conversation is at the heart of the business’s interests.

## Where’s the trust?

[“The truth is that without the consideration and effort of the CIO team, none of the systems to collect, reconcile, coalesce and structure data are available.”](http://www.logicworks.net/blog/2013/06/who-owns-big-data-cmo-or-cio/)

## They can’t both be right

Or can they? Mobile data can inform a global sales and marketing view as it is the hottest of touchpoints.

[86% of CIOs say they ‘own’ the mobile space](http://www.cio.com/article/2459965/cmo-role/cios-and-cmos-have-failure-to-communicate.html).

76% of CMOs say they ‘own’ the mobile space.

## Here’s the trust

Aligning IT with Marketing’s strategic goals across the enterprise will help to transform rapidly accumulating data into a live asset that is genuinely owned by every stakeholder.

## Horizontal collaboration is the future

* IT leaders are in the best position to map technology to the global sales marketing picture.
* Marketing leaders are in the best position to establish customer retention as a business driver for IT investment.
* A new era of trust between them will play to the strengths of both - and enable the enterprise to get a vital new perspective on data as a live resource.

## No time like the present

* 51% of technology management leaders say [they have a single view of the customer across every touchpoint.](http://blogs.forrester.com/cliff_condon/14-12-14-how_the_cmo_and_cio_will_determine_the_future_of_business_in_2015)
* 46% of marketing leaders say they have a single view of the customer across every touchpoint.

So half of IT and marketing leaders around the world are still not meeting on the common ground of strategic, global sales and marketing goals - while the other half are stealing the march.

“Businesses need great marketing operations and equally strong tech execution. The most successful companies are building strong partnerships between their CMOs and CIOs and not getting distracted by counterproductive turf wars.”

## Takeaways

* IT and marketing are key allies in the drive to a new perspective on data ownership.
* CIOs can play to their strengths as business enablers - if they engage marketing in conversation.
* Data is a resource that can - and should - be ‘owned’ by every stakeholder who influences marketing strategy, including IT.
