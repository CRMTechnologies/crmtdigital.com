Producing relevant and engaging content has to be one of the biggest challenges facing B2B marketers in 2013. Having invested blood sweat and tears (not to mention budget whether for external agencies or internal time costs) in creating your content, you want to make sure you get the most bang for your buck; how can you squeeze every bit of value out of that juicy content?

Of course successful content to support your marketing automation programmes starts with the premise of a good story, an engaging read with useful information. Huge effort naturally goes into the creative process at the front end, but rather than heave a sigh of relief once the creative phase is complete, take a moment to think about your process for maximising this valuable asset.

A successful content marketing approach relies on four core components:

* Great content
* Clearly established target personas
* Clear distribution process – right content, right time, right person
* Content scoring

This is where Content Mapping comes into play. In terms of existing or ‘older’ content, take a moment to take stock of what you already have. Take a leaf out of Santa’s book and make a list, checking it twice, and audit any out of date or irrelevant content. If you are using marketing automation software then you should have access to information about which content has been more popular and this should help you to create a score which can rate your content. You can then start to prioritise how you use your existing content, as well as influencing the type of new content you create moving forward.

Once your content is ready, think about who it is relevant to, in terms of what you know about them and also where they are in the buying cycle. This information is invaluable if you are to optimise the value of your content, which means that working on developing clearly defined personas and a solid lead nurturing programme with your marketing automation platform are essential to a successful content marketing approach.

Content mapping can certainly help you get more mileage out of your content, combining creativity with solid process for maximum results. It is really the only way to ensure you are getting the right information to the right people, just when they need it.
