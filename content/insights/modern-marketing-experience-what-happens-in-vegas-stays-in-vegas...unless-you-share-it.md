With just a little over a week until the CRM Technologies team jets out to Las Vegas for Modern Marketing Experience (MME), we want to hear from you! We’re asking marketers to tell us what Marketing Automation challenge you’d be most keen to spend your winnings on if you were to win big during MME. You can tweet us using #IfIWinBig and the best tweet will win a fabulous Apple Watch Sport.

The fun doesn’t stop there! Come along and see us on stand 236 during the show to talk about the road to modern marketing excellence and collect your CRM Technologies selfie stick. We’ll be giving another Apple Watch Sport away to the best selfie taken during MME (the more Vegas-themed the better!), so make sure you mark your tweets with #CRMSelfie to be in with a chance of winning.

We’re bronze sponsors of MME this year and looking forward to catching up with clients and partners at what is set to be a busy show. Some of our fantastic partners will be there, including Allocadia, Cloudwords, DemandBase, Lattice Engines, Lookbook, Vidyard and Zift Solutions. There are lots of content highlights too, including Ceri Jones of Basware and Mark Plant of Micro Focus, both of whom are CRM Technologies clients.

All of this going on and we haven’t even mentioned the Markies yet! Micro Focus is in the running for Best Social Campaign, so we wish them the best of luck!

Are you heading out to Vegas for MME? What are you looking forward to? Let us know [@CRMTechnologies](http://www.twitter.com/crmtechnologies) and don’t forget to enter the competitions! Find out more at [www.crmtechnologies.com/ifIwinbig](http://www.crmtechnologies.com/ifIwinbig).
