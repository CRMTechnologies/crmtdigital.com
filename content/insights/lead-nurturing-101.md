In our [Marketing Automation Glossary](https://www.crmtechnologies.com/blog/2014/02/04/marketing-automation-glossary-part-one/) we defined lead nurturing as:

**_The practice of developing a series of communications that seek to qualify a lead, keep that person engaged, and move them down the sales funnel._**

To further examine this statement, let’s break it down into the integral parts:

## Qualify a lead

Simply calling anybody that opens an email or visits your website a lead isn’t always going to cut it. Time needs to be taken to ensure each person fits with your customer profile so that resource isn’t wasted on nurturing leads that will never be converted. In order to determine this, marketers need to be clear as to what constitutes a sellable lead and understand customer profiles inside out.

## Keep that person engaged

As we’ve said, the overarching goal of lead nurturing is to gently but efficiently move leads along the buying process. This can often be across an extended period of time, so the trick is holding their attention. This is where valuable content comes into play, delivered at the right time and to the right person. It must be understood that different types of content will appeal to different people, depending on where they happen to be in the buying cycle. Those in the very early stages, for example, may be more interested in educational, problem solving content, whereas a prospect in the very latter stages might be looking for evidence of results in the form of real life examples.

## Move them down the sales funnel

This is the ultimate aim. If we continue to keep a prospect engaged but don’t actually energise them to act in some way, then they will remain stuck in limbo. Once again, your ability to do this will be as strong as your content and each piece must leave people with a compelling reason to act. This could be done by providing a call to action, a link to further information or perhaps serialising your content so that a prospect is compelled to read or download the next in the series.

Of course, marketing automation aims to make life easier by automating much of this process, but it can only be as good as the information you feed into it, so understanding the points above is crucial if you’re really going to get the most out of your lead nurturing programme.
