In 2014, CRM Technologies saw a 54% growth in sales as a result of deeper penetration into its existing customer base and expansion into new markets. To continue this trend, the company has appointed Paul Lee as its new Sales Director.

Andrew Freeman, CEO of CRM Technologies, said: “We are seeing unprecedented demand for consultancy and support across the spectrum of marketing automation as more and more companies seek to automate, streamline and personalise their marketing operations.

“Paul joins us at the perfect time to support this demand and help take CRM Technologies to the next level. He is highly experienced in driving sales growth and will spearhead our new business development strategy across existing and new markets.”

For over a decade, Paul has supported sales and marketing leaders across a variety of business sectors to help them understand how their activity drives revenue and customer engagement for their businesses. He has extensive knowledge of the marketing automation and demand generation industry, having joined CRM Technologies from Adobe where he held the position of Enterprise Account Director. He has also held senior sales management positions at Oracle Eloqua and Blueview Group.

Paul explained: “I’m delighted to be joining CRM Technologies at such an exciting time. I’m looking forward to the challenge of helping to grow an already expanding organisation at a time when the marketing automation industry is developing so rapidly.”

CRM Technologies has a clear growth strategy for the next five years, and Paul’s appointment is part of a wider recruitment drive across the company. In particular, it is seeking to grow its client-facing implementation teams with skilled, technical marketing automation experts.

Andrew concluded: “Paul’s experience as a modern marketer who understands the challenges that businesses face in transforming their sales and marketing operations in the digital age is a great asset to us. We look forward to strengthening our team with like-minded digital marketing experts over the coming months and working with this growing team to take CRM Technologies to the next stage of success.”
