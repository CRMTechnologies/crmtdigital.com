This year we’re proud to be Bronze Sponsors of Oracle’s [Modern Marketing Experience](http://www.modernmarketingexperience.com/) (MME), kicking off on the 31st March in Las Vegas. We’ve sponsored or attended this event since 2010 and have consistently supported Eloqua and now Oracle. The Oracle Marketing Cloud community is really important to us at CRM and to demonstrate our commitment, this year we’ll have our biggest presence at the show, with a team of five making the trip to attend. One of the strongest areas of focus for us is customer success stories, and MME is the ideal environment for this with the Markie Awards and breakout sessions that focus on customers’ first hand experiences.

Only just over a month later we'll be back in the US as Silver Sponsors of the North American [Sirius Decisions Summit](https://www.siriusdecisions.com/Events/Summit/2015-Summit.aspx) (12th-15th May), a first for us. We've sponsored the EMEA summit since inauguration in 2010 and will continue to do so again this year. Previously we've been delegates at the North American Summit as a Sirius client of the Demand Creation Advisory, so we're looking forward to being even more involved in 2015.

These events are not only a great opportunity to catch up with clients and prospects, but also our fantastic partners. We’ll be announcing more details of our involvement and activities at these events closer to the time, so keep an eye on our [blog](https://www.crmtechnologies.com/blog) and [news](https://www.crmtechnologies.com/news/) pages.
