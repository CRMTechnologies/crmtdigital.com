Given the sizeable investment both financially and in terms of time and resources, when considering adopting marketing automation it makes sense to take a step back and ask yourself “are you ready for marketing automation?”. There are three core areas to consider when answering this crucial question: people, processes and data. Get these three right and you will create a solid foundation on which to build a successful marketing automation programme.

## People

Marketing automation requires a fairly specific skill set that may not currently be part of your marketing team’s repertoire, so you will need to decide whether you are prepared to recruit, re-skill or outsource some of the marketing automation work. There is of course a financial commitment required in terms of training and ongoing education once you have chosen how you will resource the marketing automation requirement. From the longer term perspective, it is essential that marketing automation has buy-in at a senior level within the organisation. Adopting marketing automation is a strategic business decision that affects many areas of the organisation. Without backing at a high level, it is unlikely you will achieve your longer-term goals with marketing automation.

## Processes

For some, the adoption of marketing automation is a path to establishing clearer marketing processes. Whilst marketing automation can help you to create processes, it usually works better if the technology is made to fit your established process rather than the other way around. Looking at processes is a key element of success in building the foundations for marketing automation success, taking the time to truly think through what works best for your particular organisation before having to fit around a technological process created to suit the marketing automation platform.

## Data

Data is the oxygen of marketing automation. If your data is poor to begin with, then realistically you can only expect poor results from marketing automation. Invest in cleaning your data, detailed segmentation and accurate records will make the difference between a vibrant, dynamic marketing automation programme and simply using your chosen platform as a glorified email marketing tool. It’s important to remember that marketing automation rarely sits alone within an organisation. It is usually linked to the CRM system and so it is essential to consider how your lead management will work across both systems. Look at the entire process from click to order and understand what data needs to be collected and sorted at each stage.
