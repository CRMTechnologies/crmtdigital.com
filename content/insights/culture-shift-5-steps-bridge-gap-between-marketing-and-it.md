Marketing Operations bridge the left/right brain divide and bring an enhanced level of effectiveness into your business by combining IT and marketing functions in one dedicated team. Bringing these two previously separate disciplines together requires a cultural shift - silos must be broken down and all aspects of the business, including Sales, must be brought into play. The reward for driving such a culture change across your organisation is an enhanced understanding of the customer, increased clarity of metrics and, ultimately, business growth. Find out how Marketing Operations can be enabled through driving cultural change across your business in the SlideShare below.

### Takeaways:

* Marketing Operations can improve marketing effectiveness but it requires cultural change.
* You need to incorporate all teams into the cultural change and ensure that everyone benefits from it.
* The customer should still be at the centre of your change approach and Marketing Operations should create a multi-channel campaign to reach them.
* Marketing Operations is critical to prove the value and contribution sales, marketing and IT make to the business and is essential to improve efficiency.
