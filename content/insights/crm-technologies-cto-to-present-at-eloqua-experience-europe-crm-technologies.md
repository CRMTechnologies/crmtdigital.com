The event looks to attract members of the Eloqua community looking to ‘learn more about modern marketing and see how modern marketers at leading brands are using marketing automation expertise and technology to power revenue performance.’

Our CTO Tony Sprague will be presenting on day one of the event, discussing the market opportunity for transactional messaging and how the Eloqua API can be used to support it, as well as presenting a client case study.

Tony’s presentation will be taking place at 2:30pm on the ‘Achieve It’ track, make sure you pre-register for the session to avoid disappointment! The full agenda can be found [here](http://www.eloquaexperience.com/europe/agenda/Agenda.html).

We have also been invited to attend the Eloqua Partner Counsel this coming Monday, so looking forward to meeting other Eloqua partners there!
