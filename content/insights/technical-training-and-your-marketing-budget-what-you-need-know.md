## The rapidly changing marketing landscape.

Marketing has changed, and continues to change, at a rapid pace. Marketing technology such as [CRM systems, social media listening tools, analytics tools, data management systems](https://www.crmtechnologies.com/insights/what-marketing-operations-and-what-does-their-data-strategy-mean-your-business) and marketing automation platforms have now become [central to marketecture.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/theopriestley/2015/10/03/the-one-person-the-cmo-cant-live-without/) In fact, [91% of the most successful users say marketing automation is “very important” to the overall success of their marketing programmes](https://www.marketo.com/_assets/uploads/Marketing-Automation-Strategies-for-Sustaining-Success-Ascend2-Marketo.pdf?20150429100716).

The improbable skills gap.

Despite the vital importance of this technology in the marketing landscape, many marketers feel under equipped and underskilled; with only around [48% feeling highly proficient at digital marketing](http://qz.com/132776/marketing-has-changed-more-in-the-past-two-years-than-in-the-past-50/) and [two thirds struggling to keep pace with the changes that affect their industry](http://www.forbes.com/sites/theopriestley/2015/10/03/the-one-person-the-cmo-cant-live-without/). The key to proficiency in this environment lies in acknowledging the fact that marketing now requires a range of [skills that are far too diverse for one single person to encompass](http://www.cmo.com/articles/2013/6/18/the_rise_of_the_mark.html).

## Maximising investment means enhancing potential.

Companies must now look to embrace not just marketing technology but also the culture shift needed to capitalise on it; in short, maximising their investment by enhancing the potential of their people. This leaves companies with the [challenge of finding the staff with the range of suitable skills](http://www.emailmonday.com/marketing-automation-statistics-overview) and evolving them.  
Many organisations understand this and see the obvious need to access the new technically gifted, marketing-savvy talent required to support Marketing and Marketing Operations.

## Ensure your people have the technical training they need.

## Part I: Hiring the right people

Maximising marketing technology begins with hiring the right people. However this can be problematic, resulting in a shortage of Marketing and IT executives who are seasoned users of technology with a clear understanding of modern marketing. These skills don’t come off-the-shelf moreover they’re cultivated in the workplace, so those who do possess the talent and experience, often carry high salary demands. The [top skills for marketing jobs in 2015](http://venturebeat.com/2015/04/26/the-top-14-skills-in-the-red-hot-market-for-marketing-jobs/) included everything from content creation through to data science, growth hacking, marketing automation and basic HTML/CSS skills. [SirusDecisions warns that generalists are unlikely to excel in the changing marketing world](https://www.siriusdecisions.com/Blog/2013/May/Bridging-the-Marketing-Skills-Gap.aspx) so companies looking to train people or bring in staff from outside, or a mixture of the two, are often advised to look for those marketing and technology evangelists who have a passion for analytical thinking, reporting, training, project management, data handling and resourcing. In short, selecting the people who not only have skills but talent that’s aligned to strategic corporate goals.

## Part II: Drilling into the detail

One way of establishing where the skills gaps are likely to be found is to consider [who is asking questions of the tools, who will need to have access to the answers and to whom are they reporting](https://econsultancy.com/blog/64557-why-marketing-operations-is-more-than-a-resource-management-platform/). This can help identify where the technical training requirements lie but the point remains - marketing operations is a relatively new field and so finding out how these training needs can be met is harder than in more established Marketing or IT areas. The challenge is complicated further by the sheer variety of platforms on offer, with just [3% of B2B companies that have implemented marketing automation solutions opting for any of the four most popular platforms and more than half using two or more tool sets from different suppliers.](http://www.mintigo.com/state-of-the-marketing-technology-industry-january-2014/) Failure to identify the skills gaps in your team and address this through technical training can lead to a failure to capitalise on the benefits of your marketing technology and to combat internal resistance to change - which affects [33% of companies investing in marketing technology](https://www.b2bmarketing.net/resources/news/news-marketers-condemn-lack-investment-marketing-technology).

## Part III: Choosing a partner

With such a fragmented supplier landscape, a disparate set of required skills and the expense associated with bringing in experienced marketing technology experts, it is little surprise that many organisations are choosing to partner with a marketing operations consultancy. Such a partnership can help the business to train internal staff or outsource all, or some, of their automation requirements -- often a combination of the two. A partnership approach within a company has the benefit of access to experts in the field who can understand the differences between tool sets and how they interoperate, as well as identifying the skills that are needed to make a project work. A partnership also provides scale, access to wider talent and protects the business critical staff attrition.

Ultimately every organisation has a choice between trusting itself to run the latest marketing tools, or seeking help from those that have the experience to provide external staff, train up internal people or run outsourced services – or, as often happens, an individually blended solution combining all three approaches.

## Takeaway

*   Look for those that have a passion for analytical thinking, reporting, data handling and resourcing.
*   Introducing the right technology isn’t enough, you should ensure you have the right people.
*   Working with the right partner can help you provide your people with the right technical training.
