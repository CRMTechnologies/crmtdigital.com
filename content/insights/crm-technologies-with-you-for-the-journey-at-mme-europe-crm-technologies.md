We’ll be exhibiting on stand P1 and discussing how we can optimise the marketing automation journey to help you succeed in aligning with sales, improving demand generation and growing revenues.

Jeff Breyare, Senior Programme Manager, Marketing Database and Automation at our client McAfee Inc, will be presenting a case study based on the data work that CRM Technologies has delivered, resulting in more opportunities from fewer leads. The session will take place in the Unify Data Stream at 10:30am on Wednesday 15th October.

In addition to Jeff’s session we have a further three customers speaking at MME Europe. Mark Plant, Marketing Operations Director at Micro Focus is speaking on the same day at 11.30-12.15 in the Engage Audience track, Ceri Jones, VP Demand Generation at Basware is presenting at 13.15-14.00 in the Unify Data stream and finally Anja Johnson, SMB Channel Marketing Manager for EMEA at McAfee will be on at 14.15-15.00 in the AppCloud stream.

The event also includes the prestigious Markie Awards, for which our client MicroFocus is shotlisted in the Best Social Campaign category. We’ll have our fingers crossed for the win!

We’d be delighted to hear from others that are attending. We’ll be tweeting from [@CRMTechnologies](http://www.twitter.com/CRMTechnologies), so do keep an eye on the stream and get in touch if you’re there too.
