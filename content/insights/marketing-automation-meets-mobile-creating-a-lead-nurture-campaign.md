Successful marketing automation programmes rely on the basic principle of understanding who you are dealing with when you send content and interact with customers and prospects. Data capture and progressive profiling coupled with IP information give us a clear indication of who will be on the receiving end of any content we send out, enabling us to tailor that content according to preference and where the contact is in the buying cycle.

With the explosion of mobile devices and smartphones, however, knowing who is on the other end of the line becomes a little more challenging. This fundamental issue presents some real challenges for marketing automation programmes, especially when coupled with the ever-increasing tendency to access information via mobile devices even when not on the move, whether working or at leisure. In 2011, for the first time more smartphones were sold than PCs or laptops and 28% of all internet usage was from a mobile phone ([source](http://www.gpmd.co.uk/blog/2012-mobile-internet-statistics/)), so how do you ensure you know who is listening, engage with them and build a profile so that you can benefit from the automation features in a nurture programme

In addition to ensuring that your content is 'device responsive' and displays well on a variety of mobile screens, one effective method is to leverage the power of mobile apps, where the average smartphone owner currently spends 94 minutes a day ([source](http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/05/flurry-mobile-apps-television/)). Once someone downloads your app, you then have a platform for engagement with your customer or prospect on the move, enabling you to develop a lead nurture programme. Through apps, you can push useful and interesting content, offering preferences and options to further tailor content and develop deeper engagement.

A number of platforms are available to assist with the actual creation and development of apps, including Panvista pictured above ([http://panvistamobile.com/](http://panvistamobile.com/ "http://panvistamobile.com/")). Panvista not only manage and measure app usage, but crucially also integrate with marketing automation systems

With a bewildering array of apps on offer though, how to do you create a compelling reason to download your app in the first place? Competition for attention is tough, so you need to really put yourself in the shoes of the recipient and think 'what would make me want to download this app and keep it?'. Events are an obvious 'reason' for an app. If you are hosting a conference or event and you want to push information to interested parties and delegates, an app is the perfect solution to keeping everything in one place. The challenge comes when your event has ended and you need to avoid the delete button. With an effective nurture programme, you can push app users down an appropriate channel to tailor further content according to their needs. This will allow you to maintain the relationship with the contact, ready for the next event, or even interest them in other products and services.

Where there is no 'event' hook, making an app engaging can be a real challenge given the plethora of choice available (some 45 million apps are downloaded from Apple's App Store every day!). There are two routes to take: making it fun or delivering educational content. Whichever route you choose, the key factor is driving further engagement, ultimately aiming for data capture enabling you to push your contact into a more traditional nurture programme that gives you greater visibility of their preferences and profile information.

## Key steps in a mobile lead nurture:

1. Ensure any existing content displays and performs well on mobile devices
2. Look at creating an app to capture your audience on the move
3. Develop a compelling proposition to encourage download - something the website doesn't offer
4. Develop a nurture programme that encourages the contact to engage further, enabling profiling information and progression through the buying cycle at a pace to suit them
