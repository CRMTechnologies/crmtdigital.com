Marketers are becoming more versed in how a Demand Center can help balance the international needs of a brand to stay on a centrally agreed message with using local, agile teams to fully develop opportunities in regional markets.

SiriusDecisions defines a Demand Center as: “a central or regional hub of shared marketing services, infrastructure and processes that enable organisations to efficiently bring programmes to market by leveraging key corporate assets and best practices”.

Perhaps the best business case for this approach is not just the monetary efficiency and person hours saved by taking much of the administrative work out of field marketing, but also the way a central hub of skilled resources and technical competencies can foster a virtuous circle of [continual improvement.](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-ways-your-organisation-would-benefit-from-demand-centre-harvey)

Here are four ways in which Demand Centers can enable this continual improvement between sales and marketing.

*   ## Continual improvement through standardisation

*   ## Standardisation of technology, language and lead management

    Tools have existed for many years to help marketers strategise, plan, execute and measure, but there has also always been a problem of teams using their own platforms and keeping data to themselves. Until marketing and sales departments across an organisation use the same tools and share common processes, best practices and experiences can never be shared nor a common view of the customer achieved. Yet shared insight can not only align your sales and marketing, it can also drive continual improvement across data management, lead management, the customer experience and many other aspects of marketing and demand operations.

*   ## Standardisation of technology

    Marketing automation is no longer a “nice to have” but a “must have”. Multi-touch, multi-channel campaigns based on increasingly complex buying cycles have replaced the single act of Marketing generating a lead and then handing it over to Sales. In such an environment, sales and marketing technologies need to be able to talk to each other, and lead management standardised across departments and regions.

*   ## Standardisation of language

    Language is also an important aspect. A common language dictionary across all departments and all regions encourages alignment, while discouraging poor communication and bad interpretation of key operational facets such as lead criteria, campaign type, opportunity type, sales stage and the like.

*   ## Standardisation of measurement

    There are potentially many points of measurement for the Demand Center, however, according to SiriusDecisions, standardising on just five metrics will provide a powerful insight into an organisation’s demand creation funnel and how marketing impacts on it.

 *   Enquiry: How many hand-raisers – raw responses – did each campaign generate? Splitting campaigns by customer or prospect-type, and by cross-selling or up-selling, can further help assess an organisation’s performance at a high level.
 *   Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL): Raw enquiries must be nurtured to a qualified level before passing to Sales. This could be a simple polish by teleservices or a series of further interactions across mid-value content or web visits. Whichever direction the nurture takes, and whatever the decision when to hand over the lead, the conversion rate of enquiry to MQL must be tracked and reported, in order to identify improvement in target marketing and messaging.
 *   Sales Accepted Lead (SAL): This is an acknowledgment from Sales that a lead meets the criteria pre-agreed by Marketing and Sales, that Sales has accepted it and will follow it up within a predetermined time frame. Organisations should aim for an MQL-to-SAL metric of 90% or better. Lower rates indicate a breakdown in communication between Marketing and Sales as to what constitutes a viable lead.
 *   Sales Qualified Lead (SQL): After further discovery, be it an in-person meeting or telephone conversation, Sales will have enough insight on the SAL to determine whether an opportunity exists or not – if it does, it is categorised as a Sales Qualified Lead. This conversion rate should also be tracked and reported, as well as the cumulative size of opportunities in the pipeline (best-in-class marketing functions contribute 10% to 40% of new business pipeline).
 *   Closed Business: It’s critical for Marketing to understand the conversion of SQL to closed business for an assessment of ROI and to enable continual improvement in marketing and sales performance. Standardising on these five metrics and assessing the conversion rates and velocity between each stage provide an easy way to measure a Demand Center’s performance and fosters closer alignment between Sales and Marketing.

*   ## Continual improvement through skills development

    The creation of a Demand Center enables the alignment of both core and highly specialised marketing operations skills. As SiriusDecisions notes, B2B marketing organisations have evolved away from hiring marketing managers with strong skills solely in campaign creation. The explosion of technology across the ever-growing marketing mix means that this singular approach is not sustainable for the fast-growing business. However, the technological talent base is still well underdeveloped, and replacing marketers who are lacking in specialised technological expertise is often not an option. This scenario is where Demand Centers come into their own, providing marketers with modern marketing skill sets in lead scoring, nurturing, data insight, technology infrastructure and project management, in a centre of excellence – a rich talent pool of tech marketing experts.

*   ## Continual improvement through local agility

    The Demand Center model is often a hybrid mix of centralisation and decentralisation, providing access to corporate assets for regional localisation. Hybrid Demand Center models working along these lines enable corporate control over many aspects of sales and marketing activities, yet at the same time regional/local hubs are able to adapt these processes, campaigns, scoring models and other key elements to suit accepted best practice in-region. By adapting central control to suit regional/local needs, hybrid models blended with rigorous reporting promote the sharing of key performance metrics, leading to a cycle of continual improvement.

*   ## Continual improvement through the faster sharing of insights

    This virtuous circle of applying consistent analytics so learning can be shared also empowers marketers to react faster to real-time developments. If something is working well, a Demand Center will enable the campaign to be scaled up at speed. If a campaign is disappointing, then the reasons why can be examined and budget redistributed to a better strategy. Without a Demand Center, the risk is always there that budget will continue to flow into campaigns which are underperforming and those which are doing exceptionally well will be revealed too late to be scaled up.

Marketers have been talking for years about the knowledge economy, where insight and know-how guides success. Now we have the infrastructure to ensure that vital knowledge does not leak from the organisation, nor remain stagnant in one of its branches. A Demand Center not only provides a central resource for marketers – its greatest achievement is to foster a culture of consistent improvement.

## Takeaways:

*   A Demand Center can improve and standardise your performance measurement process.
*   Through a Demand Center, insights can be shared faster between teams.
*   Demand Centers can increase the agility of your local marketing teams.
