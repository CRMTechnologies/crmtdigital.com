Sales and Marketing operations specialist CRM Technologies has implemented salesforce.com for UK-based global software business Micro Focus plc, in a way which enables the company to significantly increase the capability of its sales activities, while retaining and integrating all of its ‘legacy’ sales, marketing and lead data.

CRM Technologies developed a bespoke integration of salesforce.com, which will provide Micro Focus’ sales teams with company, contact and opportunity management facilities, while synchronising seamlessly with the company’s established enterprise back-end business applications.

Micro Focus’ sales & marketing business applications are based around a central database application and the need for the company’s sales function to develop a more comprehensive approach to lead management, tracking and development led Micro Focus to adopt the popular salesforce.com platform, but in a way which retained its legacy data.

“All of our sales and marketing operational data resides on our chosen relationship management platform and we wanted to incorporate significantly higher levels of flexibility and functionality for our sales teams, but in a way which did not mean losing our existing data or systems,” commented Micro Focus’ Worldwide Business Systems Manager, Danial Clarke. “CRM Technologies has provided us with an ideal solution by integrating a state-of-art sales management tool with our familiar and established back-end systems in a way which improves our business processes and enables us to develop, track and exploit a wider range of sales opportunities,” he added.

As a salesforce.com consultancy and application exchange partner, CRM Technologies can offer bespoke application development services for existing customers of salesforce.com, while offering new salesforce.com users the opportunity to deploy completely customised applications which perfectly match their business needs.

Saleforce.com is one of the pioneers of ‘software as a service’ (SaaS) and its templated, ‘on-demand’ marketing applications delivered over the internet have historically been highly popular with small to medium sized businesses who do not wish to make long term, expensive licensing commitments to major marketing software vendors.

“We are delighted to have been able to deliver to Micro Focus a solution which has provided them with exactly what they wanted from both their existing and new applications,” commented CRM Technologies Director Andrew Freeman. “Historically, applications like saleforce.com have proved popular with small to medium-sized businesses, but this underlines the fact that not only is the package well-suited to global businesses, it is also possible to integrate the solution with existing business systems, without the need for a wholesale overhaul of legacy business data,” he said.

Salesforce.com is accessed securely over the Internet, enabling businesses to work from any location — home, office, or the road. According to Salesforce.com, software as a service offers data security, upgrades and round-the-clock support, with nothing to install and no costly setup fees – leaving staff with more time to concentrate on core business activities.

“CRM already has a strong history of delivering hosted and custom-built marketing applications including hosted databases, campaign landing pages and management portals,” added Freeman. “We are confident that the further innovations we will be able to offer through the salesforce model will significantly add to our ability to provide genuine, real-world value to our customers’ marketing activities.”
