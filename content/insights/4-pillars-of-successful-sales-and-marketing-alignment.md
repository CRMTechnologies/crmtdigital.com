intro = "The need to align sales and marketing functions is something that has long kept CMOs awake at night. With the advent of established marketing automation and integrated CRM platforms, many marketers are now well on the way to eliminating the silo mentality of ‘us and them’ that has existed in the past. But the differences between the two disciplines remain in many areas of business, with the net result being inefficient processes, misaligned objectives and a poorer revenue performance overall."

Ultimately the goal is to get everyone on the same page, we’re all part of one team, right? Sounds simple, but it isn’t always easy. There is no magic formula that will guarantee success, but through working with numerous clients on sales and marketing operations projects, we have identified four key pillars that lay the foundations for successful ongoing sales and marketing alignment:

## Shared vision

Before the conversation can even begin between sales and marketing, there needs to be a shared vision, an agreed common purpose and goals. This isn’t rocket science for a CMO, but making it a reality can sometimes be harder than you think. Taking common objectives of the businesses as a whole and showing how they can be adapted to suit the needs of both sales and marketing can be a good approach to ensuring alignment at the top level.

## Process

Once the common goals have been agreed, how you will actually deliver these needs thrashing out in more detail. Without an agreed process, you risk people making it up as they go along and will lack key tracking data to assess performance, giving an inaccurate picture of how your marketing is faring. The devil is in the detail when it comes to agreeing a process between departments, going through what constitutes a lead from a marketing perspective for example, piloting these criteria jointly and reassessing with the sales team on a regular basis can really help lay the foundations for a solid, long-term process that is built on mutual trust.

## Single platform

The rise in popularity of marketing automation platforms is directly linked to the need for greater sales and marketing alignment, giving CMOs the visibility of end-to-end revenue tracking. For everything to work together, both sales and marketing need to agree on the platform of choice, ensuring any additional sales and marketing technologies in use are fully aligned for a synchronised approach. Involving both parties in the selection criteria and [RFP process](https://www.crmtechnologies.com/blog/2014/03/03/are-you-asking-the-right-questions-in-your-marketing-automation-rfp/) up front can help with this.

## Communications life cycle

Keeping the conversation going is critical to ongoing success and continuous improvement of sales and marketing alignment. If things go wrong, without the ongoing relationship and established communications infrastructure to reinforce the connection, you risk unravelling all of the good work completed up front. Take some time to set up clear, two-way communications structures, regular reviews, updates and exchanges to make sure everyone keeps talking.

While there is indeed no ‘magic formula’, building your sales and marketing functions on these pillars can dramatically increase your chances of successful alignment, driving better processes, encouraging buy-in across departments and ultimately helping to boost revenues.
