Salesforce.com made a highly anticipated announcement recently at the Dreamforce '12 event in San Francisco and also unveiled locally at Cloudforce Essentials: the release of the 'Marketing Cloud'.

Perhaps better described as the 'Social Cloud', in essence the Marketing Cloud is an integration of social media monitoring, content and advertising with Salesforce's market-leading CRM platform. The features, more typically associated with the likes of Radian6 and Buddy Media, can now be plugged in to the marketing and sales pipeline to create a powerful, real-time reflection of social media trends and sentiment spread while also allowing for content to be pushed to social sites and advertisements to be placed.

The data collected by the Marketing Cloud becomes hugely valuable in the marketing automation process when used in conjunction with more traditional approaches. The insights gained from the social Web data can be tagged to the profiles of individual leads and customers within the traditional CRM pipeline. This in turn enables the user to see any direct correlation between actions in social media and revenue generated at the end of the pipeline. Could this finally be the answer to measuring the value of social media activity? Until now, evaluation has long been the issue with social media engagement as marketers seek to demonstrate ROI from activity. Perhaps Salesforce.com's Marketing Cloud could truly be a watershed; time will tell.

One thing is for sure, there will be huge interest in a tool that enables businesses to engage more with buyers through social media channels and then measure how this effects buyer behaviour though integration with CRM platforms. Count us in for starters! More information on the Marketing Cloud can be found [here](http://www.salesforce.com/uk/marketing-cloud/overview/). We are keen to know your thoughts and whether you will be using it within your business.
