So, Dreamforce is over for another year and as I sit here, waiting to board the flight home, I wonder how on earth Salesforce are going to top it next year. For those who haven't been before, prepare yourself for 140,000+ attendees and 1,400+ sessions presented with a liberal dose of education, philanthropy and pure entertainment. Couple this with production values that Andrew Lloyd Webber would be proud of, Dreamforce is quite literally overwhelming.

As a European you wince slightly at the self-congratulatory and "everything is awesome" sentiment but you soon get into the swing of things and you find yourself whooping, clapping and singing along (did I mention the music?) with your fellow attendees.

Marc Benioff is an engaging speaker and obviously a pillar of San Francisco society, conjuring up a heady mix of excellent keynote speakers including Hillary Clinton, Al Gore, Will.I.am, Neil Young, Tony Robbins and numerous CEOs of corporations large and small. All had some connection with Salesforce, either as a customer or through a common philanthropic cause. Then there was the music and parties - the former provided by the Beach Boys, Bruno Mars and Cake with many (excellent) local groups playing two music stages that were positioned, Glastonbury like, in a mock grass field complete with beanbags, giant chess sets and ping pong tables.

Marc's keynote started like a scene out of the American TV series "Silicon Valley" - picture a vast dark room with enormous projection screens showing outer space and a laser light show with a "since the beginning of time" (in a gravely voice) narration. A traditional Hawaiian welcome followed before Marc got into his stride making product announcements, welcoming guests to the stage and introducing the Beach Boys to neatly segway between topics. His co-founder (Parker Harris) joined the stage at one point dressed as a Superhero (to introduce Salesforce's new Lightning framework) - illuminated lightning bolt in hand. The finale included a drone flying above the main stage delivering personalised Coke bottles (Coke Germany is a customer).

You can see that it would be quite easy to get lost in the razzmatazz of Dreamforce but, given a bit (actually a lot) of pre-planning, it provides a fantastic opportunity to learn about the ever growing Salesforce ecosystem, talk to the many exhibiting partners and network with like-minded peers.

The main announcements this year included the continued evolution of the Salesforce 1 platform and Wave - the new Analytics Cloud (hence the Hawaiian/Beach Boys theme). For Marketing folks there was the launch of "Journey Builder" functionality in ExactTarget that allows you to map customer journeys, triggering communications at relevant points in the journey - all in a very intuitive user interface. Pardot was conspicuous by its absence in the main keynotes although there were plenty of breakout sessions to keep existing and prospective users happy.

It was the new Analytics Cloud that was positioned as the key Dreamforce announcement (actually one of their worst kept secrets, as they admitted). At first sight this looks like an excellent product - designed for non-data analysts, it allows the user to interrogate data in a very mobile/IPad friendly way even if that data doesn't reside in Salesforce. For those with an integrated Salesforce and Marketing Automation system this hopefully removes the need for a third party BI tool to analyse the end to end lead Management process. An excellent balanced summary from Gleanster can be found here:

Many Salesforce partners (predominately AppExchange partners) filled the two enormous Cloud Expo halls. Apart from the (no doubt costly) presence of the big SI's, one of the key themes was Sales Enablement in all its forms - from proposal/quote configurations through to platforms that allow Sales to customise and send sales collateral quickly and easily together with coaching engines that encapsulate best practice and play it back to sales using a playbook approach.

There is actually so much to see and do at Dreamforce that it's impossible to cover it all in the 4-days of the show. So if you are thinking of going to Dreamforce next year here are my top 5 tips:

* Book early - hotel rooms become scarce (with eye watering room rates) if you leave it late
* Do your homework. Spend lots of time referencing the online agenda builder to maximise your experience. Many sessions run in parallel and it's quite easy to miss one
* Don't overbook yourself. Most of the main sessions this year were televised so watch online in the comfort of your hotel room or one of the many screens around Dreamforce.
* Plan your route and timings between sessions. Dreamforce is spread out through the different halls in the enormous Moscone Centre and various hotels in the vicinity
* Wear comfortable clothing. Wear your Fitbit (another Salesforce customer) and you'll be amazed how many steps a day you do.

Would I go again?

Absolutely - it's awesome!
