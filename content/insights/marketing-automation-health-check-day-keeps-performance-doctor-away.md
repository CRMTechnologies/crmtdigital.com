## Is your marketing architecture fit for purpose?

It’s so well established that it’s almost a cliché by now, but consumer buying behavior is changing beyond recognition. So is marketing and if you’re still behaving as if it’s 2001, you’re probably missing out and your competitors are leaving you behind. Here are a few considerations to check your approach to marketing automation against.

## Ask...

## Do you have a consistent and concise view of your customers and prospects?

There’s no single channel from where customers and prospects can interact with you today - regardless of whether you’re B2B or B2C. Some channels might be more dominant than others, for example, social media - if there’s something to contest or provide an opinion about and/or your website - the first point of call to research products and services. And then there’s the immediacy of everything. With an always-on approach, consumers have quickly become impatient as we remain fixed to our smartphones and tablets, thirsting for instant gratification. Expectations on how consumers want to be treated has never been higher and it’s all about personalisation and individualisation.

In this environment, the thirst for a single customer view is taking  centre-stage. It is Big Data, but from a marketer's perspective it’s big data, data science, data management & data agility. Your customer has a single view of you and you can be certain they’ll expect the same in return.

Are your systems linked (MAP to CRM to ERP to Finance to Product to Analytics) so you have a single view of the customer, the entire time? How is your data cleansed and maintained?  Are you following proper privacy and data protection regulation to ensure you’re storing and maintaining data correctly and communicating compliantly? Basic principles, yes, yet all essential cogs contained in the very DNA of your marketing automation platform.

## Ask…

## Does your data strategy support your targeting and segmentation plans?

We talked earlier about knowing your prospects and customers and that they probably know you better. Have you considered persona marketing - creating profiles of typical buying groups, their professional profiles, buying traits, typical product interests to compliment your targeting and segmentation efforts? Persona marketing has proven to improve engagement and ultimately conversion.

Regularly sanity-check the composite of your data - reach, completeness, marketable/non-marketable, preference management and how this supports your targeting and prospecting activity. The bigger the database the better - not now. The insight drawn from your data, field completeness and smaller more manageable volumes will improve conversion. Your automation platform should have powerful database interrogation and management tools - make sure they’re optimised.

## Ask…

## Is Sales separate from Marketing?

Siloed operations might as well be no operations at all in the modern Sales and Marketing environment. More particularly, Sales has to be closer to Marketing than ever before because the role of the salesperson has changed.

It used to be relatively simple. The sales guy had all the power, all the knowledge and if you wanted to purchase anything of significant value and complexity, you had to speak with someone early-on in your buying journey. Now, that’s all changed - throw the book out the window! According to John Neeson, MD SiriusDecisions, “buyers agree that they navigate at least the top third and most of the two-thirds of the buying cycle without Sales”. The role of the salesperson has radically changed as the buyer now has the power.  

Today’s sales professional has adapted well to this new selling environment by aligning more closely to marketing - the custodian of prospect insight. Closer alignment has enabled Sales to focus on better quality leads, enrich the customer experience (as they’re now one step ahead of the buyer with valuable buyer insight in their kit bag and know how to interact) and close more deals.

To ensure this alignment continues, check your marketing automation platform is integrated with CRM and is optimised - regularly check there are no breaks in the integration. Leave no lead behind and make sure if you’re using scoring it’s working (not too tight, not too wide). If you’re using nurturing, check your workflows are optimised and prospects are not getting stuck at various stages (swap-out poor performing content and check decision rules) and with Sales, well take them out to dinner and regularly check-in with them!

## Ask…

## How thorough are your audits?

Whether you’re a new adopter of modern marketing or a dab-hand, always regularly audit your environment - things break, become stale, too big to adapt and things grid to a halt.

It’s always good to capture and analyse existing sales and marketing processes, after all, systems, reporting needs and people skills (as well as development) alongside how buyer behaviour is changing. Audit the lead management process, look at marketing campaign performance, how well and to what extent your systems (MAP, CRM) are utilised and integrated. If scoring is in place, ask yourself how beneficial is it, what conversions are your experiencing. How well are nurture journeys working, is a refresh of content required and finally, how is data evolving.

Too often, systems are set-up and left to run without the occasional health check. Take the time to run a periodic audit and especially monitor potential pinch-points, integration areas that are mission critical, lead management process and routing for example.

All of this sounds pretty basic in a “this is how we do it” sort of way. The sheer granularity of a modern “marketecture”, consisting of MAP, web, CRM and a great deal else, should allow a business to produce a slicker, more agile and above all more successful marketing operation..

## Now it is time to ask...how up to date are you?

## Takeaways:

*   Data is the life-blood of your business and marketing efforts - invest time in it.
*   Sales and Marketing should align as prospects and customer now own the buying journey.
*   Audit your systems and processes regularly. If it’s not broken don’t fix it is no longer applicable.
