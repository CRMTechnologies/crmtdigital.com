With an established client base in technology, engineering and a range of other B2B sectors, CRM Technologies will spearhead Demandbase’s launch to the EMEA market and beyond.

Demandbase’s Real-Time Identification platform plugs into technologies used by marketers, including CRM systems, marketing automation platforms, content management software, chat, forms and analytics. Demandbase allows customers to personalise website content targeted to specific companies without using cookies, which results in better website engagements and conversions.

CRM Technologies’ CEO Andrew Freeman commented: “Demandbase is an exciting new platform that will make a real difference to qualifying website visitors for B2B marketers. For the first time, B2B marketers in Europe will be able to truly understand who is visiting their websites and tailor content and campaigns accordingly. We are delighted to be part of the launch pad to take this product to Europe and are looking forward to getting started on client implementations.”

“Our Real-Time Identification maps billions of IP addresses to millions of companies throughout the world to deliver corporate information in real time, and we look forward to applying that insight to help personalise website experiences to both domestic and international marketers,” said Greg Ott, CMO of Demandbase.
