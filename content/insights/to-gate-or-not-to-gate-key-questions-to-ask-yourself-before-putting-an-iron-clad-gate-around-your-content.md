Do we already know this person?

If your marketing automation is firing on all cylinders it will recognise re-visits to your website, matching them up with profile information already gathered. If you already know their name and email address, do you really need to ask them again when they try to download some content? Removing the gate here will stop unnecessary frustration.

## How much information do we actually need?

If the visitor is totally unknown to you, do you need to bombard them with every single profiling question straight away? More often than not the only information you need at first is their name, email address and company name - so keep it simple.

## Can we gather the information over time?

When visitors return to your website to access more content, why not ask for a little more information each time? Progressive profiling will mean you’re more likely to get the information you need gradually, giving you a fuller picture of where visitors are in the buying cycle and reducing drop-out rates.

## Have we been honest?

This is a big one: if you’re asking for personal information, have you told people why? Honesty is crucial here, so you need to make sure that people are aware how their information will be used and for what purpose. You may also want to consider having profiling fields up-front on the page, rather than hidden behind a link (such as ‘download HERE’ that points to a lengthy form, which can naturally be a turn off). This small step towards transparency will go a long way to helping you get your hands on valuable visitor data.

## Weigh up value against risk

Ultimately, if the content on your web site offers value for visitors, at some point you will want to put a gate on it and capture the all-important data that helps you build a prospect pipeline. However, before being over-cautious, take some time to think about how and why you’re doing this.

Consider the types of content that you want to contain and the ways in which you want to allow people to reach it. Offering a certain level of content with limited information capture can help to build trust with your visitors and encourage them to delve deeper next time.

In the end, it’s about weighing up the value you are offering against the risks of providing either too much or too little access. By following the simple steps we’ve outlined above, you can take some positive steps in achieving a balance AND capturing some great visitor information for your sales pipeline.
