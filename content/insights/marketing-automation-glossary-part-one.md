Buyer Persona

A buyer persona is a profile of a target consumer or customer. It helps marketers to visualise the behaviour, demographic profile, and psychographic information of prospects. Creating accurate buyer personas can help inbound marketers better define their target audience and make better-informed marketing decisions.

## Call-to-Action - CTA

A call-to-action can be a text link, button, image, or any web link that encourages a website visitor to visit a landing page and become a lead. These could be ‘Subscribe to our newsletter now’ or ‘Download out white paper today’.

## Dynamic Content

Dynamic content is a way to display different types of website content based on the type of user. User data is captured based on past website interactions, or can even be [captured from their IP address](http://www.crmtechnologies.com/what-we-do/products/demandbase.html). According to information about that user, relevant content can be displayed to encourage further engagement and interaction.

## Inbound Marketing

Inbound marketing focuses on creating interesting content that attracts people to your website. The key is to align the content you publish with your customer’s interests and problems, bearing in mind that visitors to your website could be at varying stages of the buying cycle.

## Lead Nurturing

Lead nurturing is the practice of developing a series of communications that seek to qualify a lead, keep that person engaged, and move them down the sales funnel.

## Marketing Qualified Lead - MQL

Marketing qualified leads are prospects that have shown interest in a company by engaging in some way with their marketing activities. This may be attending an event, downloading a white paper, or having a conversation at a trade show.

## Sales Qualified Lead - SQL

Sales qualified leads are prospects that have shown an interest in the company and meet the minimum sales qualification criteria, such as having the authority and budget to purchase and are facing an issue that can be addressed by the company’s product or service.
