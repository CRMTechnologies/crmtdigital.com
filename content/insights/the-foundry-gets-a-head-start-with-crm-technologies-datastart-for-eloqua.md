When visual effects technology firm The Foundry decided to implement marketing automation software from Eloqua, they realised that in order to make the most of the features within Eloqua, their data needed to be in good shape. Digital Marketing Manager Rachael Pollard shares her experience of working with leading UK Eloqua partner CRM Technologies to clean up their data in order to begin the company's Eloqua experience in ship shape.

**Why did you decide to instigate a data audit?** When we first made the decision to implement Eloqua, we knew that we would need to tidy up our data in order to maximise opportunities with the new system. We decided to undertake a full data audit and cleanse and wanted to get some expert help. We approached CRM Technologies to assist us, as recommended by Eloqua.
