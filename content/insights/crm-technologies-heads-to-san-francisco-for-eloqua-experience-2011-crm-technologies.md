Eloqua Experience has emerged as the leading event for the Revenue Performance Management industry and a record number of attendees is expected this year. As an EMEA-based Eloqua partner, CRM will be hosting a contingent of EMEA clients for peer-to-peer networking, including McAfee, Colt Technology Services and Harris Systems.

The conference will cover a range of B2B sales and marketing topics and best practices, from lead management and demand generation to campaign analytics and marketing automation. Keynotes include a talk from Chip Heath, Stanford University Business Professor and the author of the _New York Times_ best sellers _Switch_ and _Made to Stick_, as well as an opening keynote from Joe Payne, CEO of Eloqua.

Joe Payne said of the event: “You’d be hard pressed to find another event combining the inspiration and know-how that Eloqua Experience delivers. This conference is really what Eloqua is all about: bringing together the best people in sales and marketing to collaborate and learn from each other, inspire one another and celebrate each other’s’ success. It’s an amazing personification of how technology combined with forward-thinking methodologies are transforming businesses into revenue generating machines.”
