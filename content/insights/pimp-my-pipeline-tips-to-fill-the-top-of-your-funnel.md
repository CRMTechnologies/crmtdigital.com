But keeping that top of funnel filling up can be a daunting task. Top of funnel activities can vary in success rates, with different tactics working better in different sectors, especially B2B vs B2C.

One thing for certain though is that great content, tailored to your target audience and delivered in a way they will want to consume it, is a sure way to attract more prospects to your funnel. Sounds easy but coming up with new and creative ways to develop content that will engage your audiences can be a real challenge for marketers. Below are some top tips for creating content that is sure to help top up your pipeline:

* **Get visual** – a picture speaks a thousand words is an old adage but one that still rings true, even more so as we are inundated with content choices. Make your content stand out with easy to consume visuals. Of course infographics are a fantastic way to get your key points or message across in a fun, unique way but they do take some time and investment to create if you want them to have impact. There are some free tools out there - have a look at info.gram, Canva and Easel.ly. Video is of course a key element of the content mix which is readily digestible. According to [Izideo](https://www.izideo.com/blog/25-amazing-video-marketing-statistics/), one third of all online activity is spent watching video and 90% of users say that seeing a video about a product is helpful in the decision process. Vine and Instagram offer quick video options that can keep the content fresh and bite-sized without costing a huge amount in production. Don’t overlook tools such as SlideShare which can be a fantastic way of re-inventing existing content. SlideShare can often go down well with a B2B audience who may be reluctant to press play on a video with sound beaming out to the rest of the office.
* **Give your clients and partners a voice** – take a leaf out of a journalist’s book and interview your clients and partners to create some great original content. Leverage their expertise and experience which is likely to be highly relevant and valued by your prospects to answer key questions or concerns. This one tip could go a long way to creating a whole raft of top of funnel content.
* **Team talk** – two brains are better than one and a team effort goes a long way when it comes to creating a steady stream of original content. Schedule a monthly brainstorm and make sure you keep a simple spreadsheet (or use one of the content management platforms such as Kapost and Compendium) to have an ongoing list of potential topics. Even if you just get some themes to work on, you can use tools like Hubspot’s [headline generator](http://www.hubspot.com/blog-topic-generator) to get a catchy hook that will attract readers and help fill the top of the funnel.
* **Three Rs** – re-use, re-purpose, re-write – content can be consumed in many ways and it’s worth evaluating whether you can re-purpose some of your existing content or refresh older content to make it current and relevant. When creating new content, map out the various ways it can be used; perhaps a white paper that could become a SlideShare with some key visuals or a video blog interviewing the author or spokespeople, in turn chopping these into soundbites that could then be posted via Twitter to attract attention for the long-hand version of the paper.

There are many ways to top up the content pipeline so keep an open mind, take a look at what others are doing and work out some good practice for your own organisation. With a great content pipeline, you are sure to attract more interest to the top of your funnel and keep those prospects coming back for more.
