## Sales funnel

The sales funnel is used to describe the journey that a potential customer or lead goes through, from initial contact to final sale. The best way to describe the funnel is with a visual representation…

As we can see, suspects enter at the left of the funnel, the widest point. As they progress through the sales process they learn about the product, evaluate, justify and finally take action. Of course, this is a flexible process and leads may leave at any stage, but where this model comes into its own is in understanding what content to use at each stage, what speed progression is made between stages and conversion rates.

This leads us nicely on to our next point…

## Content Marketing

As with all of these terms, there is a wealth of research and writing on content marketing. In essence, it describes a marketing technique that creates and distributes relevant content with the purpose of attracting a pre-defined target audience. As mentioned previously, it is key to understand the varying stages involved in the sales process in order to produce content that is appropriate for each stage. The goal is to produce and distribute the right content, at the right time, to the right person.

## Content

So what form can this content take? The possibilities are huge for content creation, but regularly we see it taking the form of white papers, infographics, videos, SlideShare presentations, blogs, images, memes, animated gifs, and the list goes on. This is an opportunity to get creative and produce something a little different. It is crucial of course that the content adds value in some way and is not simply a heavy sales pitch.

It seems that using lengthy, in depth content at the start of the sales funnel is going out of fashion and we’re currently seeing a big push on smaller chunks of digestible content. This can often be more difficult to produce, but when done correctly can go a long way to progressing potential leads along the funnel.

## Buying cycle

Before making any purchases, customers will typically go through a buying cycle. This is spilt in to a number of stages, where the prospect initially shows interest, then conducts some sort of product research and finally makes the decision to purchase. This is a model similar to the sales funnel mentioned above and could be very quick or elongated across an extended period of time, depending on the complexity of the product or service on offer.
