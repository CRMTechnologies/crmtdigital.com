When it comes to CTAs, each industry, target market or demographic will come with its own set of preferences. The key to success is therefore, as with many other areas of digital marketing, A/B testing. There are a wide range of variables to test, including but not limited to:

* Volume of text
* Copy/phrasing
* The action itself
* Colour of buttons, background, text
* Placement within the page
* Size of the CTA itself and the elements within
* Use of images and their size/content

Once you’ve found the most effective solution it’s job done, right? Well, of course this isn’t true – just because it’s working now, doesn’t mean it will produce the same volume of click-throughs next week. Constant testing and updating is crucial for maintaining the highest rates possible.

We’ve had our fair share of experience when it comes to finding CTAs that work and have outlined some golden rules that will apply no matter what the target market:

1. **Be clear** – simplifying your message may not always be easy, especially if the CTA is a download link for something like a complex white paper, but take the time to think about your copy and produce a concise description of what the visitor will get.
2. **Be action-minded** – if action is the ultimate goal here, then everything needs to reflect this. Think carefully about the verbs you’ll use.
3. **Be practical** – burying your CTA at the bottom of your webpage may not be the best solution. Think practically and place it in a prominent position, ensuring it fits with what’s happening on the rest of the page.
4. **Be a designer** – The design of the CTA will need to fit in with the overall design of the page it sits on, but it may be beneficial to use a contrasting and complimentary colour.
5. **Be creative** – you’ll find all sorts of blog posts telling you that their way of producing CTAs is best, but when it comes down to it you need to find a solution that works for you. This could be nothing like any of the common methods, so try something different and don’t be afraid to change it if it doesn’t work out.

When it comes to successful CTAs, the devil is in the detail so it pays to regularly review what’s working and what isn’t. These are a few rules we have found help deliver results but we’d love to hear more! Tell us about what’s worked for you or tweet us @CRMTechnologies to share your experiences and successes.

If you’ve followed these rules and found success, why not share it with us? We’d love to hear about examples of CTAs that have brought rewards for you – and also those that have helped you learn how to do better next time!
