The guide examines the cost of inaccurate data and details the steps to take towards good database management for those working in a business-to-business or business-to-consumer environment.

“Effective marketing databases may sound like an obvious prerequisite to successful direct marketing campaigns, but in our experience far too many organisations are turning a blind eye to it,” explains Andrew Freeman, Director at CRM Technologies. “Our own research suggests that 99% of UK marketing executives experience problems with managing B2B marketing databases. They find it time-consuming, labour intensive, too quick to become out of date, an unpopular task within the marketing department, too fragmented and difficult to integrate with external data. It’s mundane work, and consequently the data buck gets passed around and neglected. ”

The five-page Data Quality Guide from CRM Technologies outlines how to identify potential problems. It then goes on to discuss the rate of data deterioration, assessing the scale of the problem, steps that may be taken to halt decay and how to audit databases.

“Data quality is the black sheep of direct marketing,” continues Freeman. “No-one really wants to admit that they have a problem, or wants the chore of addressing the issue. Yet, I’ve witnessed so many campaigns where time, care and budget were invested in creating a direct mail piece or telemarketing campaign, only for it to be used along side dirty data. It’s a false economy.” he concluded.
