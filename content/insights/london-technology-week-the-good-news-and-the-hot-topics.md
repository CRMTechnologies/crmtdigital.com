It’s fantastic to see an initiative supporting the UK technology sector. [Research](http://londontechnologyweek.co.uk/2014/06/mayor-london-leaders-global-tech-scene-come-together-launch-london-technology-week/) announced by the organisers of London Technology Week suggests London’s digital tech sector is expected to create an additional £12 billion of economic activity and 46,000 new jobs in the capital over the next decade. Amazingly the tech and information sector in London, Southeast and East England is growing faster than that of California and London employs more workers in financial tech San Francisco’s Silicon Valley. This is great to hear and we’re very proud to be part of this boom.

While the breadth of topics being discussed during London Technology Week was vast, there seemed to be a few key themes that came up frequently:

## Big Data hangs on

It seems like we’ve been debating how to make the most of ‘Big Data’ for years now, yet it remains a hot topic. A visit to the events page on the London Technology Week website reveals around 15 individual events looking at Big Data alone. The message from marketers is clear: there is still a considerable way to go to cut through the ‘noise’ of Big Data and maximise the opportunities it provides.

## Head in the cloud

Many of the events went with cloud computing and cloud storage as their central theme. This is becoming an accepted way of working for many, yet inevitably it’s an area that some are still looking to understand and learn about. Certainly in marketing automation, the sector that we specialise in at CRM Technologies, there’s been an explosion in cloud-based solutions, with all of the major vendors offering their own variation. Once again, there is still some work to be done to ensure marketers can take full advantage of the cloud.

## And finally…People are hungry for more

The good news is that the success of and support for London Technology Week demonstrates an overwhelming desire for technology events and education in the UK, suggesting there is a lot more potential for growth in this sector. If the predicted figures become a reality then not only will this be great for the industry, but for the economy generally. It may still be some time before the full potential of new technologies is realised, but the buzz created by London Technology Week shows that there is a real hunger for this to happen!
