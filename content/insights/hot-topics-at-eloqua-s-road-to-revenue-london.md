This Wednesday 28th November sees Eloqua's Road to Revenue Tour hit London. There will no doubt be some great discussions and insights into key marketing automation issues and we've highlighted a few below that we think will be hot topics.

Our CEO Andrew Freeman will also be presenting on the importance of standardising data, looking in particular at two tools, our Normalator Eloqua App Cloud Connector and Demandbase, a real-time website visitor content personalisation tool.

The day-long free event, designed to give both Eloqua customers and non-customers an insight into the marketing automation platform, will feature a number of presentations covering hot topics currently being discussed in the industry.

Here's our take on some of the issues that are likely to be considered:

## Lead Lifecycle Management

This is a key topic for all involved in CRM, and one that those that are new to the game must have a firm grasp on. The tactics that are likely to be discussed include nurture marketing, lead prioritisation, pipeline analytics and lead scoring. Successful use of these techniques requires an all-inclusive management of the lifecycle, covering marketing, sales and customer service.

## Social Media

Social media is no longer a new topic, but it is clear that there is still an uncertainty for some as to exactly how it can be used to benefit the CRM process. The importance of Social CRM is becoming more evident as case studies emerge of brands and businesses successfully combining their social media presence with CRM. The big news around this is the new Marketing Cloud from Salesforce.com, but this is a topic best saved for a blog post of its own so watch this space!

Sales and marketing alignment is at the heart of effective marketing automation and the role that social media can play in achieving this continues to be widely debated. Integrated social media features within sales and marketing automation platforms is one such attempt to encourage conversation and socialising between teams that may be hundreds of miles apart, both physically and ideologically.

## Real-Time ID

According to the MarketLive survey, websites only convert 3.8% of visits. This is a remarkably low figure and the ways in which it can be boosted are sure to be on the agendas for many if not all digital marketers. Personalisation plays a key role in helping the conversion rate and a tool that we will be discussing is Demandbase, a real-time targeting and personalisation platform for which we have been appointed the first partner outside the USA. Our CEO Andrew Freeman will be demonstrating the Demandbase platform during the 'Eloqua AppCloud' session between 11:45am and 12:30pm.

## Privacy

An ever increasing issue as tracking technology develops, privacy has become a buzzword in the industry. With increasingly stringent regulations on privacy, including tracking, and hefty penalties for non-compliant companies as a result of the EU directive on privacy it is more important than ever for marketers to think carefully about the value in their message. If a prospect receives an entirely irrelevant message, then the likelihood of them taking issue with it is high. However, if the message is targeted and delivered at the right time then it will be beneficial for both the prospect and the marketer.
