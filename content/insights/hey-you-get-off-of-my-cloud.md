It seems that it is not only The Rolling Stones that will be shouting about clouds this weekend. It was only a few weeks ago that the marketing world was discussing Oracle's acquisition of Eloqua and more recently Salesforce.com's acquisition of ExactTarget and Pardot, but now there is a new announcement in the long line of Marketing Automation/CRM mergers - Adobe and Neolane.

The $600 million cash purchase, which seems relatively cheap when compared to the $2.5 billion that Salesforce paid for ExactTarget, was announced by Adobe earlier this week on 27th June, some four years after Adobe's purchase of Omniture in 2009.

Neolane's campaign analytics, segmentation, profiling capabilities and numerous other features will all be integrated into Adobe'e Marketing Cloud. In the arena of independent Marketing Automation providers this really only leaves Marketo and Silverpop, but it will be interesting to see if they follow the consolidation route as many of their competitors have.
