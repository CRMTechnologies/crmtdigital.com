It has been a busy few weeks of presenting and attending several key conferences and events relating to marketing automation and sales alignment. Tomorrow, our CEO Andrew Freeman will be presenting at the [B2B Marketing Summit](http://www.b2bmarketing.net/summit2012) to be held at the London Brewery. Andrew will talk through the McAfee case study, looking at how we helped to develop a comprehensive lead nurturing and lead scoring system that has generated impressive results for McAfee. We would love to see you there so do let us know if you will be attending (tweet us @CRMTechnologies). If you would like to know more about the work we did with McAfee, you can read the full case study [here](http://marketingoperations.crmtechnologies.com/?p=134). McAfee recently won one of the first [European Markies](http://marketingoperations.crmtechnologies.com/?p=176) at Eloqua Experience Europe in recognition of their achievements in lead scoring so come along and find out more about how they delivered revenue performance improvements through marketing automation.
