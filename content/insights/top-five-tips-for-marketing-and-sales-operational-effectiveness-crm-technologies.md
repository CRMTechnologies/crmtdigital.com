Anyone involved in marketing automation would support the view that sales and marketing alignment is critical to ensuring long term success. Achieving the end goal of being able to track enquiries through to sales conversion from the earliest stages of the marketing process requires some fundamental elements to work in harmony if this alignment is to be made possible. Through working with clients on numerous marketing implementation projects, we have identified five key areas that underpin a successful programme:

* Process

Identifying a business's key processes is sometimes an arduous task and one that many companies will procrastinate over. However, this is critical to marketing automation success. It is important that you reach beyond the marketing and sales process itself and look to the rest of the business. If there are any areas that can be improved, stick to the 80:20 rule and don't try to change everything in one fell swoop! Look for process gaps, especially those related to data quality.

* Data

Most companies have multiple sources of data and struggle to build a single customer view. Try to map out all your sources of data, even if this is a laborious process. Data is a dirty word sometimes for marketers, but it's good to get your hands dirty and clean up that data!

* People

Without buy-in from the team, any project of the magnitude usually associated with marketing automation is doomed to failure. Clear, regular communication is essential. Build a vision for the company on how this new programme will make a difference. Also think about the skills of the team and what might be required now and in the future. Engage the team at every stage of the evaluation for a smoother marketing automation journey.

* Technology

Your chosen marketing automation platform will underpin the elements outlined above. It is essential that you undertake a thorough review of requirements before beginning your selection process. Engage users throughout the various stages and use real case scenarios when looking at demonstrations from vendors. Always refer back to your original objectives and requirements before making a final decision.

* Partnerships

Effective sales and marketing alignment delivered through marketing automation is a long journey. You will need to build strong relationships with key partners to continue to develop and achieve your objectives. Think about how you will leverage support from your vendor and also about specialist agencies or suppliers that can help you to plug a skills gap or provide extra resource at different points along the way.
