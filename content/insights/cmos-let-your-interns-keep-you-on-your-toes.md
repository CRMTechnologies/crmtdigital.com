97 percent of CMOs think marketing must do things that it’s never done before to be successful. 85 percent of CMOs think marketing takes responsibility for actions that nobody thought it would three to four years ago([1](https://solutions.forrester.com/bma-survey-findings-ramos)). Clearly evolution is essential to marketing’s survival and the pressures on CMOs to constantly reinvent the wheel are ever increasing.

A big part of creating fresh marketing campaigns involves keeping a finger on the pulse of the latest marketing trends and being aware of the changing perceptions amongst your target market. This is an important part of the CMO’s role, but it’s equally important to let other members of the team share the burden.

Taking tips from younger, junior interns or graduates may not feel natural, but if you’re looking to speak to a generation that’s foreign to you as a CMO then this is a good place to start. One generational group that many marketers have no doubt come across recently is the millennials. They are the largest generation by number and have ever increasing purchasing power, meaning they’ve very quickly become interesting to marketing professionals. As with any generational group they have their own quirks, characteristics and buying patterns that will call for a shift in marketing strategy. This will require an in depth, almost second nature understanding of what works and what doesn’t work for this generation. Who better to provide this insight than those that have first-hand experience?

The value of a millennial mind-set in your marketing team will go further still: millennials have grown up with technology as an instinctive part of their lives. They won’t necessarily remember a world without the internet and seeking out technology that helps streamline their life, both in a personal and business sense is second nature to them. This sort of drive is hugely valuable in the ever developing world of marketing technology, especially when you consider that some experts estimate there to be between 1,000 and 3,000 digital marketing solutions currently on the market([2](http://marketingland.com/creating-martech-strategy-can-pay-big-105544)).

If you create a culture where the junior team members feel confident enough to share their thoughts without it falling on deaf ears then you’ll begin to gain valuable insight. Don’t be afraid to let them keep you on your toes – you may have long term experience and technical knowledge, but they can ensure your marketing is relevant, up to the minute, and on message.
