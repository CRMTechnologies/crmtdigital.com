The certificate covers every aspect of B2B marketing best practice; from planning and budgeting, data to creative, and media to measurement. Practitioners with this qualification are able to deliver the most relevant, up-to-date, expert advice to UK B2B marketers.

Cook says: “This is another first for CRM, with its investment in leading-edge training, to ensure that it can offer world-class B2B marketing capability that caters for any operational marketing challenge.”

The qualification was initiated and developed by the IDM B2B Council in a move to address the imbalance of B2B and B2C marketing training provision in the UK.
