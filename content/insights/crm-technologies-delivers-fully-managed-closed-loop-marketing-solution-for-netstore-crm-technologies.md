This follows the development of a fully-managed, end-to-end marketing database solution by marketing data services specialists, CRM Technologies.

Providing Netstore with a complete ‘closed-loop’ marketing management environment, CRM Technologies’ expertise has brought together all marketing data held by Netstore’s external telemarketing, event management and PR agencies, consolidating it with the company’s own Siebel ‘On Demand’ sales & marketing management system, via Siebel Web Services.

As well as seamlessly integrating the company’s data cleansing, enhancement, quality monitoring and integrating emarketing, CRM Technologies has also given Netstore managers a complete and real-time picture of all of the company’s marketing activities, together with measurement criteria for assessing return on investment (ROI) for individual campaigns.

Netstore had previously operated a number of individual data sources – held by its own departments and also by individual marketing services suppliers – none of which were capable of integrated operation. The company had also acquired a number of businesses – all of which had operated separate marketing information systems.

“CRM Technologies has provided us with a ‘single-view’ of our marketing which brings together all of our previously separate databases and marketing processes into a fully-managed, integrated marketing environment, which can tell us when, where, why and how we reach out to each of our individual customers or prospects across the Netstore enterprise,” commented Netstore’s Group Marketing Director, Alan Edwards. “Marketing data now no longer means a simple list of names & addresses – we now have a meaningful, comprehensive company marketing tool which will enable us to intelligently target our customers and prospects using a set of fully-synchronised processes,” he added.

“Its great to see a leading managed services provider like Netstore moving to a managed marketing data services model itself!” commented CRM Technologies director Andrew Freeman. “Measurement and ROI are becoming increasingly critical factors in new business campaigns and Netstore will now be able to intelligently target new prospects, as well as precisely measure campaign value and results,” he said.
