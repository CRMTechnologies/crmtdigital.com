Our new ‘Ops Talk’ blog series takes a look at the practical steps involved in addressing two key aspects of marketing operations methodology: the internal challenges that corporates face in filling the ‘pipeline’ and moving leads through the customer journey; and the considerations of brand, data capture and customer experience that marketers face at a programme level.

The end goal is the same at both levels - attaining that seemingly elusive return on marketing investment. Our aim in this series is not to talk about the theory and concepts (the ‘why?’) of achieving that investment, but to provide practical advice at every level (‘I’ve got it, now how do I do it?’) for delivering integrated, profitable programmes using marketing automation as one of your key tools.

## The internal challenge of marketing

Marketers are under ever greater pressure to identify more suspects and prospects, provide better qualified leads to sales, quantify the lead lifecycle and show a return for marketing spend. The concept of the Lead Lifecycle is, of course, not new and it is likely you already have defined processes and stages represented in several ways:

As a flow chart. Or, perhaps, as a funnel

The basic premise of these representations is the same: we are interacting with large numbers of ‘suspects’ and our aim as marketers is to guide them along a path towards a sale, or at least an engagement with sales.

As a process, it often feels like we are feeding a hungry animal with fickle tastes and idiosyncrasies. Added to this, at each stage we are being scrutinised and monitored to ensure that marketing is providing an adequate return on investment.

The view from the street

Marketers are arbiters of how prospects and customers perceive the corporate brand, style and attitude. Furthermore, there is an expectation from the prospect or customer that marketers should be responsible custodians of their data. From this aspect, the Lead Lifecycle is defined in different terms: those of the customer experience or the customer journey.

In this context, marketers will be developing content relevant to the customer journey and will have defined routes to ensure the best experience for the prospect.

## Two approaches: one aim

We know that the end game for marketing operations at the corporate and programme level is to achieve a return on the efforts and investment made at each stage in the prospect or customer journey. There are practical steps along every stage of this journey that need to be considered from both perspectives.

For example, early in the lifecycle your aim is to capture the identity of prospects and qualify them to establish their value to sales. But at the same time you need understand the needs of the prospect, their preferences, their interests and their experience of your brand. Sometimes these two goals can be slightly conflicting as you aim to accurately qualify a lead while respecting client preferences.

So, you ‘get’ the need to automate your marketing operations: prospects and customers are savvier than ever. They will have researched (by which I mean Googled) you and your competitors before they ever engage with your sales people. Your website is your shop window but your campaign emails, press articles, social interaction and external links are the routes to this engagement.

But now you need your marketing automation platform. There to improve your customers’ experience, maintain preferences and opt-outs and provide tools to respect your responsibility to your prospects/customers, a marketing automation platform is the means of binding all these disparate threads together and managing and reporting on your Lead Lifecycle.

If you haven’t yet made this investment, or you have but don’t know how to get the best out of it, the guides in this series will provide you with essential reading – and some excellent suggestions for selecting, implementing and running successful marketing automation programmes that deliver long-term results.
