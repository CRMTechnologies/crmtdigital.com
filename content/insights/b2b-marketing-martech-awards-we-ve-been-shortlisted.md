We are thrilled to announce that our own [Demand.Center](https://www.demand.center/) platform has earned us not one, but two nominations for this year’s [B2B Marketing MarTech Awards](https://b2bmarketing.get-stacked.net/martechawards/) in two categories, _UK-founded martech vendor of the year_ and _Emerging vendor of the year_.

Demand.Center is the first solution that has been specifically designed to help marketing organisations scale their global campaign management, improve production quality and speed-to-market, ensure consistency, and provide 360-degree insight into the campaign production process.

Andrew Freeman, CEO of CRMT Digital commented, “Following our Gold award last year for the ‘Best Use of MarTech for Sales’ we are delighted that we have once again reached the shortlist in two categories this year. Our Demand.Center platform has been gaining traction rapidly as organisations accelerate their adoption and scaling of digital channels and it is exciting that it has been recognised alongside its peers in the industry”.

The Martech award winners will be announced at a virtual awards ceremony on the 24th and 25th March 2021. We want to congratulate all nominees and wish them good luck!
