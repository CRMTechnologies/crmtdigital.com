We recently attended TFM&A in London, along with many others in the marketing sector. Whenever these sorts of events happen you can always expect there to be a lot of discussion about the current hot topics or buzzwords, and TFM&A was no exception.

Content marketing, big data and mobile usage continue to be high on the agenda for marketers generally, but within the Marketing Automation world we noticed another trend emerging: the consolidation of promotion and messaging from the big three vendors (Oracle, Adobe and Salesforce) around The Marketing Cloud.

It’s clear that that marketers are looking for more than just marketing automation - they want social media, content and data all under one roof and the vendors are responding to this with their own marketing clouds. The following extracts are taken from the Oracle, Adobe and Salesforce exhibitor profiles:

The situation is improving as vendors are bringing everything together in one place and this is what people are looking for, but there is a way to go until this is clear and simple. The fact that they are all pushing a similar message makes it hard to draw distinctions. The question is, how strong is the suite of technologies in each vendor's marketing cloud and who will win the race for true integration of the technologies in the marketing cloud stack?

It’ll take some time for an answer to emerge but what’s already clear is the importance of structuring RFPs effectively to draw out the distinctions so that comparisons can be made. In fact, we wrote a [blog on this very issue](https://www.crmtechnologies.com/blog/2014/03/03/are-you-asking-the-right-questions-in-your-marketing-automation-rfp/)!
