The general premise behind marketing qualified leads and sales qualified leads are, on the face of it, pretty simple. As we’ll hopefully show here however, the difficultly comes when trying to decide the point at which a lead moves from one to the other.

A marketing qualified lead has been qualified based on some level of engagement with marketing. This will often be web-based marketing and could cover activities such as downloading white papers, reading case studies, requesting a consultation, clicking on social media links, signing up for newsletters or any other interaction with online content. The lead scoring process is often employed here, attributing a score to each activity and feeding the data into the marketing automation system. Only when the appropriate threshold score is reached or criteria fulfilled will the lead be passed to the sales team. In theory this will prevent the sales team from going in too early and also give them the additional information they need to do their job more effectively.

Sales qualified leads, therefore, are qualified based on their engagement with sales, determining their readiness to buy. Simple right? Well, not really. Pinpointing the moment at which a lead is ready to be passed over to sales is crucial and not easy. It requires the sales and marketing teams to work closely together (which at times can be a battle in its own right) and will vary drastically from company to company.

There’s no set magic formula that can be applied, but there are a number of triggers that can be considered by any company when attempting to determine if a lead is ready to be passed to sales:

## Behaviour

* What level of interaction have they had with marketing/sales?
* How long did they spend on the website?
* What pages did they visit?

## First time/frequent visitor

* Has the lead visited the website before?
* Does the company have a higher conversion rate with first time visitors or does it require a number of visits before they are ready to move on to the next stage in the buying process?

## Source

* How did they find your website?
* What content did they engage with to get to your website? How might this inform you about what stage they are at in the funnel?

## Purchasing history

* Is the lead new to your company?
* Have they purchased products or services from yourself or your competitors previously?

Ultimately, this process attempts to place leads at the appropriate levels within the marketing funnel to ensure they don’t end up in the sales teams’ hands too early and equally don’t get bombarded with general marketing messages if they are further along in the decision process. It’s important that the entire MQL and SQL procedure is under constant review as it relies on so many factors that could change at any time. Don't get stuck in a rut even if you think it’s working OK. Set regular review periods to keep the conversation with sales moving and ensure you are making the most of your leads.
