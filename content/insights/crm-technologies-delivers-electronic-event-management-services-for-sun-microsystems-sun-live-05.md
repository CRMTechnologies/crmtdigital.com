For global IT vendor Sun Microsystems’ flagship annual end-user & partner event, ‘SunLive 05’, which took place at The Brewery, London on 22 March 2005.

CRM Technologies handled the implementation and execution of a personalised e-marketing campaign designed to complement existing direct marketing activity, including outbound email tracking, intelligent registration, post-event follow-up, campaign click-thru tracking and online reporting facilities.

The service also tracked registrations from the direct marketing activity, partner activity, and Sun account manger activity – all driven through a dedicated URL. All campaign data was drawn from and updated to Sun’s marketing database, delivered as a hosted service by CRM Technologies.

SunLive05 provided an opportunity for Sun’s customers and prospects to see the company’s networked model for enterprise computing. Successful organisations are exploiting network computing to improve performance and gain a competitive edge.

“We were really excited to be working with Sun on this campaign,” commented CRM Technologies consultant, Alison Saunders. “Our goal was to drive registrations for this flagship event while ensuring that the campaign monitoring and real-time reporting activities provided the most accurate and up to date information for telemarketing activity prior to the event,” she added.

“CRM Technologies already provides us with a series of invaluable outsourced marketing database service functions, and their combination of marketing, data and technology expertise helped to ensure a successful event and follow-up for us all,” added Sun’s UK Product & Solutions Marketing Manager, Jon Tutcher.
