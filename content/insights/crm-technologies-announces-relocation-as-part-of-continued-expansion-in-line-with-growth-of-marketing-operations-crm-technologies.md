# CRM Technologies announces relocation as part of continued expansion in line with growth of marketing operations

CRM Technologies, a leading marketing operations consultancy, has announced that it is relocating thanks to continued business growth. The company will be moving to Green Park, Reading, Berkshire on 3rd July.

CRM Technologies serves a global client base that spans Europe and North America and has experienced 54% growth over the past year. Its relocation is part of its continued five-year expansion plan, which has also seen a number of new senior management appointments including Paul Lee as Sales Director and Sean Seelochan as Professional Services Director.

Andrew Freeman, CEO of CRM Technologies, said: “The role of marketing is seeing exponential change and growth and we are ideally placed to meet the needs of businesses seeking to transform their organisations through marketing and sales alignment. Our relocation not only allows us to cater for our rapidly expanding team but makes us even more accessible for our diverse client base.”

According to figures from the ITSMA/VEM Marketing Performance Survey 2014, 85% of respondents are expecting huge changes in marketing to drive optimisation and to be able to demonstrate its value to the business. This is putting pressure on marketers to improve their own skill-sets, maximises their investment in technology and engage with a wider community of supporting partners to realise their goals.

Freeman continued: “Our expansion comes at the ideal time to meet the needs of this increasingly sophisticated market. We have exactly the right combination of expertise, skilled teams and understanding of the demands placed on marketing and sales to enable business to embrace marketing automation and use it to deliver measurable Return on Investment.”

Green Park is hub for major global organisations and growing technology companies alike, being ideally situated along the M4 corridor and within easy reach of major transport links. Extending across 195 acres of parkland, its unique buildings have been designed for space and sustainability while its landscape and lake promote productivity and balance for employees.
