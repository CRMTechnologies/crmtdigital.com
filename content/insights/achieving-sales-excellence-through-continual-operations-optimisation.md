Sales and Marketing are often described as “soft” sciences. That’s odd, because Sales has always had the hardest-edged KPIs of all. After all, **if Sales don’t sell, folk don’t eat**.

**But you knew that already**.

The hard numbers of monthly targets, response rates, average customer revenues - these were all Sales metrics _way_ back when “marketing” just meant advertising.

Which is why the newish field of Marketing Operations, despite its name, isn’t really about marketing at all.

**Marketing Operations is about Sales** - and using a focus on technology to achieve sales excellence.

Let’s look at how Sales can contribute to Operations, through helping it **continually improve** - leading to an uptick in sales figures as a happy outcome.

## 1\. Nailing the right CRM system: go high-touch not hard-edged

With around 80% of CRM rollouts not delivering hoped-for results, it seems a lot of people are less than happy with how their software measures up. Bottom line: if sales people are complaining about having to use CRM, you’re stuck with a poor implementation.

It may be subjective. But subjective feelings matter. Are your people spending time keying in data when they should be selling?

Modern CRM systems work _with_ your people, not [make them jump through hoops](https://hbr.org/2014/12/why-sales-ops-is-so-hard-to-get-right). When note-taking and record-keeping - all the flotsam and jetsam of data capture - become effortless, the raw material of operational improvement is processed **effectively and in real time**.

So to achieve sales excellence, first **address the grumbles**. Operational improvements are only as good as the data that goes in.

## 2\. Improving the process: make it flexible not brittle

It’s amazing how many companies use CRM to duplicate obsolete business processes. So as a second step, double-check your CRM workflows against **the actual procedures your people go through every time they make a sale**.

After all, they know how customers think. (Better than a piece of software does.)

Ruthlessly look at every click, step and hoop your system makes your people jump through. Ideally, nothing is compulsory save accuracy - the best data isn’t formalised and over-structured, but honest utterances in natural language. [The greatest source of insights into customer behaviour](http://www.salesbenchmarkindex.com/blog/is-your-sales-operations-department-the-island-of-misfit-toys) is often the ‘Notes’ field attached to your friendliest contacts.

To achieve sales excellence, **don’t look solely at the data that fits into neat boxes**.

## 3\. Completing the loop: giving Sales insights that matter

The moment of truth for Sales guys, of course, is whether they feel their CRM is **delivering for them** - giving them hard returns for their inputs. How many customers are ready to spend £50,000 before year-end? Whose business is getting talked about more across social media?

(And while you’re at it, give me that data in the form of Call Appointments and Tickle Dates, not a grab-bag of numbers.)

Sales people, more than anyone else outside the C-suite, know [what drives a business is revenue and profits](http://www.insightsquared.com/2015/05/right-role-for-sales-ops/). They’ll be happy with any CRM that really, really helps them deliver that.

## From the boardroom

People matter more than software. But if that tool’s used properly, it can achieve sales excellence for the whole business… _including_ those in IT and Marketing. The technological transformation of sales operations is something everyone can agree on.
