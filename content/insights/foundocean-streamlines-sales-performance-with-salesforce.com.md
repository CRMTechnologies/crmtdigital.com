FoundOcean is a subsea and offshore grouting specialist for the global energy construction industries. The firm approached CRM Technologies in December 2010 with a view to implementing Salesforce.com across the business, aiming to create a single customer view and consistent information source on customer communications. We spoke to Marketing Manager Rebecca Morgan about her experience of implementing Salesforce.com with CRM Technologies.

**_Why did you choose to adopt Salesforce.com?_** I joined FoundOcean in April 2010 and the company had been using a Microsoft CRM system that had been significantly adapted but adoption amongst the team was poor. I personally had a fair bit of experience of using Salesforce and, having reviewed processes within the company, I felt that Salesforce could benefit FoundOcean significantly in terms of functionality and improved management of customer communications.
