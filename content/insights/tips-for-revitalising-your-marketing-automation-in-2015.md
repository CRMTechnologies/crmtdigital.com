As a marketer you will no doubt be running reports and analysing data on a weekly or maybe even daily basis. This New Year, why not go one step further and put some time aside for a full marketing automation audit? Here we’ve outlined a few areas to focus on:

## Lead scoring

When was the last time you really looked closely at your buyer personas? Are they still accurate? Make sure that your lead scoring process still reflects buying habits.

## Segmentation

It’s all too easy to drown in data if you’re not careful. This January, try consolidating overlapping lists, archive old lists that are no longer relevant and double check your segmentation triggers or tags.

## Content mapping

This is likely to be a big task and perhaps one that will go beyond January, but if you are taking a fresh look at buyer personas, it’s also important to re-map your content. This doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll need to create a whole new batch of assets - we’ve written a number of blog posts on this very issue, including ‘[Are you getting the most mileage from your content?](https://www.crmtechnologies.com/blog/2013/01/22/are-you-getting-the-most-mileage-from-your-content/)’

## Reports

We know that reporting is an integral part of marketing, but is there anything that your regular reports are missing? Your marketing automation efforts may be producing data that isn’t relevant on a weekly basis, but it could be beneficial to consider some ‘deep dive’ reporting every now and then. You may gain some otherwise inaccessible insight.

## Integrations

Successful modern marketing will often rely on integrations. This might be between marketing automation and CRM systems, or any number of smaller integrations made available by the various app clouds on offer. If these integrations aren’t working correctly, they could do more damage than good. Use this month to make sure they are all working properly and decide if they are still required, or indeed if more are needed.

If you’re a marketing automation veteran, then running through the checks above will help keep your marketing effort as efficient and effective as possible.
