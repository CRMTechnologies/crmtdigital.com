Now in its ninth year, the B2B Marketing Awards celebrates the brightest stars in B2B marketing. The event always offers a great combination of entertainment and real marketing success stories, and we’re expecting this year to be no different.

We’re proud to sponsor the 2014 award for _Best Integration of Sales and Marketing_. Integrating sales and marketing is core to everything we do at CRM Technologies, and it’s great to see such a strong line-up of contenders in this category.

With a shortlist of 12 excellent campaigns, including Canon’s demand generation campaign by The Marketing Practice, 'A revolution in sales enablement' for PayPal by Purestone and the 'Fastest path from first click to sale' for Trelleborg Marine Systems by Stein IAS, we’re excited to see who will scoop this year’s accolade. This is one of the top three categories for the number of short listed entries, so it will be closely contended.

It’s no mean feat to bring sales and marketing together to deliver measurable value to your business, so the opportunity to celebrate those who’ve achieved success is not to be missed. If you’re attending the awards ceremony, we look forward to seeing you there!
