Whatever we do, we must balance the internal need to capture quality leads and our responsibility to the prospect or customer’s preferences, requirements and experience.

Our first job is to ascertain the value of a contact: Is this someone we should be talking to and do they want to talk to us? In sales we may establish this in a one-to-one interaction. In marketing we will be communicating with hundreds or thousands of contacts so we need an automated means of answering these questions. This is where your Marketing Automation Lead Scoring is used.

There are many <em>Lead Scoring</em> mechanisms providing a numeric or alphanumeric representation of lead value. Most Lead Scoring techniques have a common structure using separate demographic and behavioural scores. These two measures are then combined into a final score which is used to determine our next marketing stage based on thresholds.</p>

There are many _Lead Scoring_ mechanisms providing a numeric or alphanumeric representation of lead value. Most Lead Scoring techniques have a common structure using separate demographic and behavioural scores. These two measures are then combined into a final score which is used to determine our next marketing stage based on thresholds.

You may define the thresholds in your lead lifecycle, giving them names such as Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL).

_Lead Scoring_ will be a well-defined process in your Marketing Automation platform. But here are some rules of thumb:

<p><img style="float: right; margin-top: 0; margin-left: 10px;" src="https://crmtdigital.com/sites/default/files/Pic2.png" alt="" width="283"></p>

* Keep it simple. No more than 4 or 5 levels within Demographic and Behavioural scores.
* Avoid BANT (Budget, Authority, Need and Timing) questions - let sales do this level of qualification.
* Avoid pick lists if at all possible - use auto-complete fields instead (more on this in part 2)
* Lead Scoring is an ever evolving process. It is something you will revisit regularly and adjust to suit current requirements. Schedule six monthly reviews of your Lead Scoring.

_Lead Scoring_ can also enhance the customer experience. Identifying strong buying signals (such as visiting the “How to buy” page) justifies engagement with sales earlier in the process. The Lead Score can help prioritise the leads in a Sales person’s queue, allowing the most engaged leads to receive the first contact.

In part two we’ll take a closer look at tools available to deal with free text and the importance of auto-complete fields in the progressive profiling process. Keep an eye on our Twitter stream ([@CRMTechnologies](http://www.twitter.com/crmtechnologies)) for news on this.
