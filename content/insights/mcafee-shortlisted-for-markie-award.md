We are delighted to report that our client McAfee has been shortlisted for a Markie award in the Event Nirvana category - so a huge congratulations to them! We worked closely with McAfee on integrating their webinar series with their lead nurture programme to optimum effect and are delighted that the campaign has been shortlisted! In addition, Diane Walker of McAfee has been shortlisted in the Marketing Visionary category. We would also like to congratulate Manhattan Associates, another client of ours, who have also been nominated in the Event Nirvana category. Eloqua's marketing awards, or Markies, honour marketing innovation, revenue performance, and outstanding results. Eloqua has reported that this year's Markie award finalists were chosen from an impressive group of more than 200 submissions. Event Nirvana was a fiercely contested category and we are delighted to be part of the team that delivered this project. The awards ceremony will take place on 7th November at Eloqua Experience in Florida, so we will keep our fingers crossed until then!
