Marketing Automation is a term which has increasingly become part of the marketer’s everyday vocabulary. Yet for some it is still unclear exactly what marketing automation is, so we thought we’d have a go at defining it for those fairly new to the term.

Put simply, Marketing Automation is the process of automating everyday digital marketing activity. The aim of Marketing Automation is to assist with data capture on customers and prospects, allowing for more detailed profile information. This then creates opportunities to automate the type of content those individuals will receive according to their profile information and where they are in the buying cycle. Ultimately, Marketing Automation is the engine that drives demand generation, with the goal to use tailored content to nurture the prospect and to progress along the buyer’s journey so that they become a qualified lead.

There are a fair number of marketing automation software vendors now, offering platforms with varying degrees of sophistication and price tags. Using information about your customers and prospects, you can define a sort of ‘flow chart’ of activity within marketing automation software according to the behaviour of people receiving either your marketing emails or those landing on your website (this relates to inbound marketing which we will address in another post). If, for example, you send out an email (using a marketing automation platform) which includes a helpful ‘how-to’ article and your customer clicks on the ‘read more’ button to download a paper, you can pre-programme a range of options of what should happen next to progress that customer further down the sales and marketing funnel, with the ultimate aim of creating a Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL).

MQLs are passed on to the sales team who can then accept or reject these leads. Clearly the aim is to create high quality MQLs that are accepted by the sales team, followed up and ultimately converted, giving a truly holistic view of how well your marketing is working in terms of revenue generation. Marketing Automation has, for many businesses, become a critical element of creating true sales and marketing alignment, another term we hear used a lot in marketing these days.

Marketing Automation is being used by business large and small, both B2B and B2C, to maximise lead generation opportunities. Take a look at some of our case studies on how we have helped customers make the most of Marketing Automation or get in touch if you would like to know more about how it could help your business.
