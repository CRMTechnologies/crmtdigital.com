Last week we were social media sponsors at [Eloqua Experience Europe](http://www.eloquaexperience.com/europe/) where the Eloqua community gathered to share insights, best practice and learn about new developments to enhance the marketing automation experience. Eloqua has a strong social media presence across multiple networks, as you might expect, and we aimed to enhance the viral buzz around the event with our own social media campaign, ensuring that the Twitterwall was busy with a live feed of active tweets throughout the two days.
