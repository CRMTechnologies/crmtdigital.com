Our specialized partnership status has been awarded based on our extensive experience of working with enterprises to on-board their Eloqua systems, optimise use of Eloqua's sophisticated functionality and help to develop best practice.

Andrew Freeman, CEO of CRM Technologies, commented: “To be the first Oracle partner in EMEA to achieve Oracle Marketing Cloud specialization is a real accolade. It is testament to the commitment of our teams who have worked tirelessly to ensure we reach – and exceed – the level of technical skill, experience and industry knowledge required to achieve this status.”

Neil Wilson, VP Oracle Marketing Cloud at Oracle, said: “Our partners are incredibly important to Oracle. The landscape of marketing is ever changing and with new acquisitions, rapid portfolio expansion combined with an aggressive growth plan, the partner community become even more important asset for Oracle. It is fantastic news that CRM Technologies Limited has achieved specialization accreditation and even more impressive is they are the first EMEA partner to do so. This demonstrates their continued commitment to marketing automation and we look forward to partnering with them to develop new opportunities. ”

Oracle Specialized Partner status gives CRM Technologies customers and prospective customers the peace of mind that we have the skills and expertise to provide the detailed consultancy, support and technical knowledge they need when implementing or working with Eloqua.

At the same time, the partnership provides CRM Technologies with access to the latest Eloqua training and resources, ensuring our expertise is maintained as marketing technologies and methodologies evolve.
