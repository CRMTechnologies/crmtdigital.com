The summit will look to explore how technologies used in personal lives are starting to change the world of business and how this is likely to impact organisations in the future. The summit will be delivered in three parts, split across finance and operations, human resources and marketing and sales.

Andrew Freeman will present at 2pm on 30th April. In a presentation titled “**TalkTalk Business: Lead Management challenges licked with LIP”,** Andrew will explore modern marketing in the digital age, focusing on marketing automation and lead generation with real case examples lifted from TalkTalk’s journey to a best-in-class modern marketing organisation.
