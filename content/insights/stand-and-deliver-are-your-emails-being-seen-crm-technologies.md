That could be 20% of your customer base gradually losing touch with your organisation – or it could be 20% of your prospect database that has absolutely no idea what you are offering.

Yes, you could blame over-zealous ISPs inadvertently causing a bit of ‘collateral damage’ in their ongoing (and entirely reasonable) fight against spam. But, the bad news is that the true cause may well lie right on your own doorstep – because the way you send email now plays a major part in whether or not it reaches its intended target.

That’s why CRM Technologies has introduced a brand-new ‘deliverability’ service – a facility you can benefit from whether your emails are sent via us, another third party, or in-house. So how does it work?

**Content Scoring:** First, we analyse your email content using over 4,500 rules. We also reference blacklists and identify any volume or identity based filters that could stop your email reaching the inbox’s of your customers/prospects. We then provide a report and detailed analysis on the any problems identified and advise on the specific changes required to maximise email delivery. You can then be assured that your legitimate, permission based emails have the best chance of reaching your intended audience.

**Email Optimisation:** We can also analyse and render your email content in the major B2B and B2C desktop, web-based email clients. This will show you how these emails will look in the most popular mobile devices in the world, within an interactive report. We show previews, images on/off and where the fold line sits. We also ensure W3C and WDG code compliance, verify the text and HTML versions of the email. We optimise English as well as foreign language emails included multi-byte languages. We validate that all links and redirects are working and minimise load times.

**Email Delivery Tracking:** Finally, we can track what happens to your email once you have sent it out and it reaches the ISP/Enterprise that it is intended for. Is it being delivered to the junk folder, being deleted or arriving in the Inbox as intended? No anti-spam solution is perfect and legitimate email is being lost in the process. This service tracks email true inbox delivery at over 300 ISPs/Domains in 70 countries around the world.

We provide a report that shows what percentage of your emails are reaching the inbox, being redirected to the junk folder or simply being discarded by the ISP/enterprise. This allows you to compare your results against industry benchmarks, see true open, click and conversion rates based on true inbox delivery and easily monitor delivery of emails sent from in-house systems, external agencies or list vendors.

In many respects, this is the final link in the e-marketing chain and surely must be considered an essential component of any true ‘closed loop’ marketing system.
