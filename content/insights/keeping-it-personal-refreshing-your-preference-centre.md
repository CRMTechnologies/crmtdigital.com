We are all on the receiving end of usually what amounts to an overload of email information. In a world where thousands of messages are pushed daily to our target customers, getting the right message in front of people at the right time has never been more important. In marketing automation terms, delivering successful email campaigns linked to nurture programmes relies on a number of factors, not least of which is an effective preference centre.

Delivering irrelevant information, perhaps in a foreign language with alarming frequency could easily drive your prospects and customers to hit the dreaded 'unsubscribe' link. One way to limit or avoid this is by demonstrating you want to understand their requirements for information, giving them the option to tailor what content they receive to suit their preferences better with a 'pre-emptive' preference centre update campaign.

Whilst many B2B marketers may set out to provide a wealth of choice in order to tailor content effectively to their audiences, some preference centres can become outdated and no longer as relevant as they once were. As the New Year gets under way, it's a good idea to take the opportunity for a bit of a Spring Clean (well, winter clean anyway!) and review whether those choices are still relevant.

## Feeding up bite-size pieces

In a world where busy professionals are increasingly time-poor, asking them to review their preference centres could seem like another task to extend their action list. One answer to this, without compromising on the wealth of options, is to make the experience easy to digest with a visual, tiled effect (like Windows 8). This is an approach we have adopted with some client implementations, enabling users to hover over a topic area, such as language, and instantly see a drop down of options, even if they choose not to select. This way the user sees the wide range on offer, but does not have to scroll through a long list of options and potentially give up or, worse, unsubscribe entirely! The tiled approach also adapts easily to responsive design, enabling a good user experience on any device - from smartphones to desktops.

## Right content, right time, right person

We have been preaching about the importance of delivering the right content at the appropriate point in the buying cycle to the right person if you are to achieve your goals of delivering improved revenue performance through marketing automation. This is only possible with effective preference centre management, in addition to clearly established buying personas and effective lead nurturing. Know your customers and ask them what they would like, after all, good customer service starts by asking what you would like!
