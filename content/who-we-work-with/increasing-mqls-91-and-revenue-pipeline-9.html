				<h3 class="mt-5">The Challenge&nbsp;</h3>
				<p>The aim was to automate a webinar series to create a better customer experience by targeting the right people with appropriate content, according to their needs and their position in the buying cycle.</p>
        <p>McAfee also needed rich analytical data on attendance, feedback on the topics covered and the speakers, and a single system which could be used to refine offers. The new, automated program:</p>
        <ul><li>Targets both prospects and existing customers for cross-selling opportunities</li>
        <li>Sends similar messages to technology partners</li>
        <li>Is designed to support the sales team and the nurturing program by accelerating the sales process.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Without automation, these tasks are both highly complex and time-consuming.</p>
				<h3 class="mt-5">The Solution</h3>
				<p>The refinements to the McAfee webinar series delivered significant improvements to the customer experience and resulted in a major increase in the sales pipeline:</p>

        <h3>What activities did CRM Technologies undertake?</h3>
        <p>To improve targeting and content tailoring, CRMT helped McAfee segment their customer base. This involved analysing the Eloqua customer database to reveal:</p>
        <ul class="clearlist"><li>Profile information.</li>
        <li>Customer behaviours.</li>
        <li>Stated customer preferences.</li>
        <li>Previous webinar attendance/non-attendance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These new segments were then used to create more accurate target groups, and tailor email campaigns accordingly. Those customers who failed to attend a webinar and prospects in the final stages of the nurture cycle were also sent automatic invitations to attend the next event.</p>

        <h3>What were the key achievements?</h3>
        <p>CRM Technologies helped build the workflow, email creation, registration pages and reports, including dashboards to automate as much of the process as possible.</p>
        <p>According to McAfee, the Eloqua automated webinar program, assisted by CRM Technologies, is delivering tangible results through tailored content and enhanced sales and marketing alignment.</p>			</div>
