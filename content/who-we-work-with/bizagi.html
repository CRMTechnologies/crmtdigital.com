				<h3>What activities did CRMT undertake?</h3>
				<p>A series of discovery sessions were carried out to principally review and validate investments made in marketing operations to date; to identify gaps where further investment in process &amp; skills should be applied; and to assist with the gap analysis between operational requirements and marketing system functionality.</p>
				<p>Following the assessment, CRMT’s marketing automation specialists used scoring methodology to rate system functionalities and integration capabilities between the market leading platforms in the B2B marketing space, against the current marketing automation technology.</p>

To support Bizagi in their journey following selection, CRMT carried out best practice workshops to map out Marketo migration, educate on advanced processes and build a strategic roadmap to guide the organization's continued development and demand generation maturity.</p>
