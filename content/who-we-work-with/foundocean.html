				<p class="h5 meta">FoundOcean is a subsea and offshore grouting specialist for the global energy construction industries. The firm approached CRMT Digital in December 2010 with a view to implementing Salesforce.com across the business, aiming to create a single customer view and consistent information source on customer communications. We spoke to Marketing Manager Rebecca Morgan about her experience of implementing Salesforce.com with CRMT Digital.</p>	
				<h3 class="mt-5">The Challenge&nbsp;</h3>
				<p>We had multiple sources of customer information internally, held on a variety of databases, spreadsheets, people’s individual email contacts and more.&nbsp;</p>
				<h3 class="h5 meta">There was no single source of information on how we were communicating with customers and some prospects.&nbsp;</h3>
				<p>This made it difficult for management to get a clear view of the status of projects we were tendering for. It was also time-consuming for the team as they would have to spend time searching for the latest update or getting a brief from their colleagues.&nbsp;</p>
				<p>Our main objectives with Salesforce were to implement a single customer view of all communications and information, as well as ensuring adoption amongst the team of the new system.</p>
				<h3 class="mt-5">The Solution</h3>
				<p>We now have no duplication of information and have a single customer view. Monthly reporting is much easier and efficient as all of our information is joined up, enabling everyone to see the latest update in context and make informed decisions. In particular, our management team are able to access information that previously would have required one of us to prepare in a report format; we have certainly developed more of a ‘help yourself’ culture now.</p>
