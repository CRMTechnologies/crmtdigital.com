				<p class="h5 meta">Financial management software company Basware appointed CRM Technologies to initiate a more comprehensive database marketing strategy using Eloqua’s marketing automation platform.</p>	
				<h3 class="mt-5">The Challenge&nbsp;</h3>
				<p>Basware’s marketing organisation is a highly functioning, geographically distributed group, divided into a corporate marketing function and regional field marketing. Corporate marketing provides a shared services capability for global campaign definition, content development, PR, AR, product marketing and marketing infrastructure functions, including the Eloqua marketing automation platform. The regional field marketing organisation is divided into five operations regions: North East (Finland &amp; Russia); Scandinavia (Norway, Denmark &amp; Sweden); Europe; North America; and APAC.</p>
				<p>Basware is actively pursuing a programme of rapid business growth on a global basis. One aspect of this strategic initiative is the need to increase their digital marketing footprint and establish a basis of measurement for their marketing communications performance. Additionally, they needed to facilitate a greater alignment between Marketing and Sales.</p>
				<ul><li>Increase digital marketing footprint.&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Establish a basis of measurement for marketing communications.&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Increase alignment between Sales and Marketing.&nbsp;</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 class="mt-5">The Solution</h3>
				<p>As a result Basware’s overall approach to marketing has changed and the quality of marketing increased. Basware saw a 115% increase in contact database size and now have a much greater focus on data quality and segmentation. Outbound email volumes have now doubled and response effectiveness is now able to be measured.</p>

				<h3>What activities did CRMT undertake?</h3>
				<p>It became clear that Eloqua offered Basware the best overall solution and a clear growth path for future requirement, and that CRMT were the best partner to work with as they are Eloqua certified and were already engaged on DataStart. CRMT and Eloqua has contributed to laying the foundations for Basware’s accelerated growth and supported the launch of their Invoice Ready solution.</p>
				<ul><li>Put in place foundations for growth</li>
				<li>Altered perception of marketing across the company</li>
				<li>Mapped in future requirements</li>
				</ul><p>The first sale of InvoiceReady in North America was directly attributable to an Eloqua-generated lead. In addition to the sales and marketing success they have experienced using Eloqua, the internal impact of CRMT and Eloqua on Basware has been equally important. The internal perception of marketing within the company, right up to executive team and board level, has changed with the visibility and insight that the Eloqua platform now provides.</p>
