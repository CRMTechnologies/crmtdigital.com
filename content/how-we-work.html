				<h3 class="h5">Strategise</h3>
				<p>Today’s marketers are a new breed of multi-skilled experts and the pressure to deliver results quickly with less investment has never been so intense. Forward-thinking departments are now aligning marketing operations to key business performance objectives to drive effectiveness, ensure efficiency and to prove the value of marketing.</p>
				<p>CRMT enables Marketing and Sales teams to achieve effectiveness through optimum allocation of resources and the adoption of best-in-class processes and technology. These are aligned to a long-range view of organisational objectives - delivering true value via a paradigm shift in marketing and sales execution.</p>
				<p>This shift from tactical to strategic thinking is driven by a necessity to understand the true contribution that Sales and Marketing functions need to deliver on objectives. Coupled with the continual evolution of buyer behaviour and the complexities inherent with today’s marketing technology ecosystem. By tightly aligning strategies, objectives and delivery organisations are better equipped to achieve revenue expectations and to deliver exceptional service to customers and buyers.</p>
